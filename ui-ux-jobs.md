<p><br></p>
<p>Our app is now downloaded more than 75M times a year, and our private search engine packaged with it has become the #2 search engine on mobile in over 21 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands. Oh, and we've been profitable since 2014 with revenue currently exceeding $100 million a year! Now, we’re rolling out a suite of new privacy solutions, including <u><a href="https://www.spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/" rel="noopener">Email Protection</a></u>,  <u><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-app-tracking-protection/" rel="noopener">App Tracking Protection</a></u> and our first-ever Desktop Apps for <u><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-duckduckgo-for-mac/" rel="noopener">Mac</a></u><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-duckduckgo-for-mac/" rel="noopener"> </a>and Windows.</p>
