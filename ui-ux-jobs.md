<div>OnTheGoSystems helps people and businesses from around the world go global. Our software makes it possible to create multilingual websites and software, no matter the size of your budget. We’ve been around since 2010, serving over 200,000 clients and have constantly evolved. Now we’re starting a new project and are building its core team.<br><br>
</div><div>The clients for this project are software developers. They expect things to “just work”, without having to spend hours figuring out how. You will design a web application and elements for clients’ mobile applications that work with it.<br><br>
</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>What your job as our UI/UX expert will look like<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We plan for several months in advance so that we all know what we’re aiming to achieve. Then, we have weekly planning meetings and daily “good mornings”. The rest of the time, you need to manage yourself.<br><br>
</div><div>You’ll know our products, clients and competitors inside and out. You’ll work together with marketing and engineering to understand what problems we’re solving and what’s unique about our solution. You’ll need to deeply know what clients love and what they rather avoid.<br><br>
</div><div>You’ll plan how clients will accomplish their work using our product, with little effort and no frustration.<br><br><strong>What is required for this role:<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>+3 years of experience doing UX/UI design</li>
<li>Proven experience building mass-market products. <br><br>
</li>
</ul><div>Candidates do not need experience with specific software, as we think great UX/UI designers with experience on large-scale projects can do a great job and learn any tools needed on the job. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>This is the ideal job for you if:<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>You see the big picture:</strong> We have a flat hierarchy and no silos. Everyone in the team needs to know everyone else, the product and the clients. You’ll do your own research and come up with creative solutions.</li>
<li>
<strong>You get things done:</strong> Discussions are fine, but results are what matter. We’re looking for designs that we can build on over time and that clients love using.</li>
<li>
<strong>You’re both an achiever and a team player:</strong> Everyone in our team has a great internal drive for success and results. We know that it’s impossible to build something big alone, so teamwork is critical to us.</li>
<li>
<strong>It’s nice to work with you:</strong> We work a lot, so we want to make sure that we enjoy this part of the day. With the right people, work feels good. You’ll be looking forward to Monday mornings instead of dreading them.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>And yes, <strong>you’re a great designer</strong> :-)<br><br>
</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>Full-time work in the European timezone<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Our development team is in Europe, so this position is only relevant for designers working in the European timezone.<br><br>
</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>Perks and Benefits<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Besides working with great people on exciting projects with cutting-edge technologies, you will receive:<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>A steady and competitive salary</li>
<li>Paid vacation per your country’s holidays</li>
<li>Home-office setup</li>
<li>Any tool that you’ll need to get the job done</li>
<li>Access to professional courses and literature</li>
</ul><div>If you’re interested in joining us, please send your application. We’re very eager to meet you.</div>

We believe in giving a personalized approach to mentoring students. What this looks like is grading student deliverables on a weekly basis, offering detailed feedback, teaching/modeling concepts that are challenging for students, and/or giving them career pointers about the industry.

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Independent UX/UI Designers (along with developers &amp; product managers) to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</span> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </span>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Full autonomy:</span> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</span> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Keep 100% of what you earn: </span>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
