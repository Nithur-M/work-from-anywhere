                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Independent UX/UI Designers (along with developers &amp; product managers) to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</span> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </span>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Full autonomy:</span> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</span> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Keep 100% of what you earn: </span>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral" rel="nofollow">https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral</a> + mention Remotive. </span>No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">What you’ll do:</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </span></p>
