<div><em>Are you good at analyzing UX on websites using heuristics? Do you like discussing the smallest of UX details?</em></div><div><br></div><div>We’re seeking a full-time remote UX Auditor for our auditing team.</div><div><br></div><div>Baymard Institute is an independent e-commerce UX research organization – beyond conducting our own large-scale research studies for Baymard Premium, we also conduct client-specific work in the form of ‘UX Audits’.</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>-- <strong>The Job --</strong>
</div><div><br></div><div>As a UX Auditor, you will be responsible for conducting client-specific<a href="https://baymard.com/audits/site-element"> UX audits</a>, 90% of the job will be:</div><ul>
<li>Analyzing the UX of some of the world’s largest e-commerce sites – this is performed as an extremely detailed heuristic evaluation using a proprietary system and workflow, where Baymard’s research catalog of 700+ e-commerce UX parameters is used as the weighted heuristic (anchoring the audit in solid UX research).</li>
<li>Identifying and prioritizing findings for the client site into a set of suggestions for improvement.</li>
<li>Writing it all into a 50-150 page report and presenting it to the client in a 2-hour video conference call.<br><br>
</li>
</ul><div>Depending on your qualifications, other roles will be possible over time.</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div><strong>-- Qualifications --</strong></div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for the following qualifications for this role:</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>(7/7) Firm understanding of UX and user behavior</strong> – in this role, you will <em>not</em> conduct usability testing yourself with end-users, but rather be performing heuristic evaluations – analyzing the UX of a website across Baymard’s 700+ parameters/heuristics. This will require a firm understanding of UX and user behavior. Having experience with performing usability testing (remote or in-person testing) will be a plus (but is not a strict requirement).</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>(6/7) Finding attention to detail exciting</strong> – in each audit, we analyze the client site across 700 UX parameters, each of these 700 parameters then has 4-7 defined implementation nuances the audit must account for. This requires an extreme level of attention to detail and excitement for exploring the smallest of UI nuances of a site. Our best auditors know all 700 parameters, and most of the nuances within, by memory.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>(5/7) Rigor over time</strong> – while the typical audit project lasts just around 2 weeks (and you’ll, therefore, work for a new and interesting e-commerce site roughly every 2nd week) – the auditing <em>process</em> itself and the underlying UX research dataset doesn’t change that much. So the UX Auditor role requires that you have a high degree of stability and will find it exciting to look for the same set of 700+ e-commerce UX nuances all year round (although obviously applying that dataset to a very wide variety of sites and clients).</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>(4/7) Ability to communicate UX in writing</strong> – the primary deliverable for an auditor is the 50-150 page audit report. As the audit report relies on the foundation of Baymard’s vast catalog of UX research findings, but at the same time is a bespoke consulting project – you as an Auditor have to be good at accurately describing complex flows and user behaviors in writing. The audit reports are often read by a team with diverse backgrounds (managers, UXers, designers, and developers) – they all need to understand the described UX issue in just 4 paragraphs of text.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>(4/7) Comfortable with client presentations</strong> – while audits are never presented in-person at the client offices (due to global clients and somewhat short projects), the audit report deliverable is always followed up with a 2-hour conference call where you will be sharing your screen, walking the client through the audit report and key findings. Prior experience with client meetings and an ability to (correctly) answer general questions on anything related to e-commerce UX will be a plus but is not a requirement. Full fluency in spoken English is a requirement; other language skills are a plus.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>(2/7) Good understanding of web-jargon</strong> – being able to describe the differences between ‘auto-complete’, ‘auto-fill’, and ‘auto-correct’ on the spot will be a necessity when presenting and discussing your findings with a diverse set of clients.</div><div><br></div><div>Each of the above qualifications is weighted, 7 is the highest.</div><div><br></div><div>
<em>(Note that this is </em><strong><em>not a UX Designer or a UX Researcher job</em></strong><em>. At Baymard, we don’t perform any kind of client design work. If you are looking for a UX designer role, this role is not for you. If you are looking for a job where you will be performing a lot of direct usability testing with end-users, this role as a UX Auditor is not for your either (but do sign up for our </em><a href="https://confirmsubscription.com/h/y/CE3E7AE3F840C82E"><em>job alert</em></a><em> as we do hire UX Research Writers from time to time).</em>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div><strong>-- Other Job Specs --</strong></div><ul>
<li>Salary: in accordance with qualifications, but typically in the range of EURO 35,000-60,000 per year / USD 45,000-65,000 per year before taxes, contributions, etc., and with 25 days of annual paid time off (invoiced as a contractor — except for UK and IE residents where we are a registered employer).</li>
<li>Start date: as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Location: this is a remote full-time position.</li>
<li>Language: we expect you to be fully proficient in written and spoken English.</li>
<li>Travel: Is limited; expect only 0-1 week of optional travel each year (in connection with the optional, company-wide meetup).</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>-- How to Apply -- </strong></div><div><br></div><div>If you’re interested in this position, please apply by sending the following documents:</div><ol>
<li>A cover letter – describing how you fit the role and qualifications — and a link to your LinkedIn profile. <em>(1-2 page PDF. Required.)</em>
</li>
<li>A resume – describing your background and past experience. <em>(PDF. Required.)</em>
</li>
<li>Record a 1-2 minute video where you quickly present yourself. <em>(Required.)</em>
</li>
<li>Any samples or other documents; for example, heuristic evaluations you’ve performed, UX-related articles you’ve written, designs you’ve created, etc. <em>(Optional.)<br></em><br>
</li>
</ol><div>Send the above to <a href="mailto:info+auditor2022q4@baymard.com">info+auditor2023q3@baymard.com</a> (all applications and materials are treated confidentially).</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Deadline is July 24th, 2023 (end of day).</strong></div><div><br></div><div><em>Note: Based on the applications, a few selected candidates will be assigned a paid 10-hour hiring test, which will be the main evaluation criterion for the position. This will also be a good way for you to get a feel for the primary task of this job. (The test will be performed remotely. You’ll be given the task to audit a live website and describe your findings within a 10-day deadline.)</em></div><div>
<br>Tip, if you want to <em>prepare</em> the best possible consider:</div><ul>
<li>reading our <a href="https://baymard.com/audits/site-element">audit sales page</a>,</li>

<p><strong><em>First off, this description is a wishlist, not a checklist. We want to find a super-amazing person to join our team, and we’re well aware that “super-amazing” can come in all different forms. If you’re a little less experienced on a specific bullet point, or if you didn’t go to a fancy school, apply anyway. We look at candidates, not resumes.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p>Standard is a sort of talent management agency and production company for thoughtful YouTubers and podcasters. We do a lot of things, so it’s hard to explain it all in a single paragraph, but our mission is to empower independent creators. Most of our time is spent talking or working with the creators directly, one on one or in a group, coming up with better tools and toys for them.</p>
<p>We’re a distributed company. We have offices in NYC and Denver, but more than 50% of the team is remote, in exotic locations like the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Ohio.</p>
<p>There are things to do and meetings to be had, but we pride ourselves on our flexibility. We think this makes Standard a great place to work for people with families, or whose productive hours tend to be outside of the 9-5. We care about what you do more than when you do it.</p><p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p>Nebula is looking for a talented UI Designer with technical expertise, solid and confident UI skills, design systems experience, a passion for order and a scrupulous eye for detail. You’ll be joining a small design team building the Nebula user interface across all our current and future platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work closely with the design and product teams to create and enhance the Nebula user interface.</li>
<li>Create design deliverables such as user flows, wireframes, lo-fi and hi-fi layouts, prototypes.</li>
<li>Design, maintain, and document a library of multi-platform UI components.</li>
<li>Coordinate with other design team members to ensure consistent and accurate communication.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We're Looking for</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A confident UI designer with at least 5 years of experience and strong UI design skills; typography, layout, usability, accessibility</li>
<li>Experience in creating and maintaining design systems</li>
<li>Good knowledge of major platform guidelines (Apple HIG, Material Design, etc.) and ability to adapt UI components according to these guidelines</li>
<li>Ability to work across multiple target platforms</li>
<li>Strong experience creating documentation for developers and designers</li>
<li>A critical thinker with creative problem-solving skills and a high level of attention to detail</li>
<li>Open and flexible communication skills, responsive and responsible mindset (experience working on a distributed team is a plus)</li>
<li>Proactive, independent working style</li>
<li>Unwavering commitment to usability</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nice to have</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience with TV app platforms</li>
<li>Experience following A11y standards</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Perks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Competitive salary between $60,000-$100,000 USD or local international equivalent. We do not use formal job titles internally and similarly named positions may have different compensation levels. Actual starting salary will depend on various considerations, including: work experience, skills, specializations, training, and location.</li>
<li>Flexible work hours and vacation policy.</li>
<li>Diverse, socially-minded team of nice people.</li>
<li>Medical, dental, and vision plans.</li>
<li>401(k) and other benefits.</li>
</ul><p><strong>How We Hire</strong></p>
<p>We think that diversity is important. Many of us have non-traditional backgrounds. We work in the online education space, so we understand how much can be learned on your own, on the Internet, outside of a classroom.</p>
<p>We’re looking for people who are curious and passionate. Our team should be made up of people of all sorts of backgrounds, gender identities, and bodies who can help to expand our perspective and improve our ability to treat our creators and our audience with thoughtfulness and empathy.</p>
<p>If that sounds like you, we’re happy to care less how many years of experience you have or where you went to school. Apply anyway. And if you have any feedback on how we could reach or appeal to a more diverse pool of talent, get in touch.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: “tv” is part of our domain, not our name.</strong></p>

<div>
<a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior UX/UI designers (along with developers &amp; product folks) to team up with the hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. <br><br>After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.<br><br>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>High-paying, meaningful UX/UI design missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>How to apply:<br></strong>Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack</a> + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><strong><br>What you’ll do:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to be the lead designer for impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline.

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Independent UX/UI Designers (along with developers &amp; product managers) to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</span> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </span>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Full autonomy:</span> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</span> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Keep 100% of what you earn: </span>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
