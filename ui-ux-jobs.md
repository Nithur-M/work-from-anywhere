<div>
<strong><br>Hello, Human Understander.<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<br>We are looking for an exceptional person to join our team, but we’ll go more into those details shortly. First, let’s talk about why this role and our company might be a good fit for you and your skills.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>Why work at Yoko Co?<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Mission</strong>. We work with mission-driven clients. This is a chance to do work that has a genuinely positive impact on the world.</li>
<li>
<strong>4-Day Work Week</strong>. We offer "flex" Mondays off. You'll get most Mondays off. We're still a high-performance culture, so periodically, you'll still need to log some Monday hours to keep projects moving.</li>
<li>
<strong>Holiday Breaks.</strong> We offer nearly a week off at Thanksgiving and two weeks off for Christmas.</li>
<li>
<strong>Best Place to Work</strong>. We were named 2020 and 2021 Best Place to Work by the Inc. 5000 and Washington Business Journal.</li>
<li>
<strong>High Caliber Team with Kindness.</strong> You'll work with team members who are both top performers and genuinely kind and supportive.</li>
</ul><div>
<br>Everything we do reflects a rare and authentic commitment to our values. We're committed to having a positive impact in the world, and doing truly great work while supporting the life balance we all want as human beings. This combination is rare, and so is the degree to which we genuinely live those values and work them into the DNA of how our company operates on a day-to-day basis. We're looking for others who share those values. If you do, you'll find Yoko Co is an uncommonly amazing place to work and contribute.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>If you work here, you’ll:<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Do research, conduct interviews, and create website strategies to help our clients increase their impact and achieve their missions.</li>
<li>Be more than just a “person with a plan.” You’ll also help execute, get your hands dirty, and do what needs to be done.</li>
<li>Be involved at critical points throughout the full process, from wireframes to design concepts, from the first kickoff meeting, to the final QA.</li>
<li>Collaborate closely with designers, developers, and project managers, to ensure everyone is on the same page and working towards a common goal.</li>
<li>Guide organizations along a path of digital transformation, helping them refine their web presence, and increase their impact.</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>You’ll do well in this job if you:<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Have a firm grasp of web design and development, content marketing, search engine optimization, web content management software and the platforms that make it happen (WordPress, Hubspot, Google Analytics, etc.)</li>
<li>Have created UX deliverables for websites like Personas, User Flows, Information Architectures, and Sitemaps at a high level of execution and complexity.</li>
<li>Can “lead the room,” communicating comfortably, clearly, and empathetically with executives, marketers, and stakeholders.</li>
<li>Have direct experience leading a team and a client through the strategic aspects of website redesign and marketing projects. (Ideally, you should have 25+ projects under your belt.)</li>
<li>Understand the principles of UI/UX design and marketing that get results, including the buyer’s journey, conversion orientation, calls to action, marketing automation, and more.</li>
<li>Are flexible, and understand that sometimes you’ll have to wear an unexpected hat or two when the situation calls for it.</li>
<li>Comfortably walk the line between the "what to do" and "how to do it" path of building a website with the ability to understand the underlying technology that makes the website experience happen – and then explain it to clients.</li>
<li>Hold yourself accountable, and deliver on your commitments.</li>
<li>Love sharing your knowledge and helping to level up your colleagues and clients.</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>However, maybe don’t apply if:<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>You prefer to work on a single big project at a time. We all have to do a bit of juggling around here, and while we wish we could pour ourselves into just one thing for weeks at a time to make it perfect, that’s often not the reality.</li>
<li>You’ve ever said “that’s not my job” or “that’s below my pay grade.” While we try to utilize everyone in the best way we possibly can, sometimes things can get dicey and we have to pitch in to help reach the finish line.</li>
<li>Your experience is mainly building apps and digital products without a lot of work on websites (especially large, content rich websites).</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>The interview process:<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<br>You’ll do 3-4 interviews with various members of our team, starting with a short culture interview, and then moving onto more specialized conversations. Somewhere in the middle of the process, you’ll likely do a short practical test to ensure you can deliver at the level it takes to be successful here.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>What you get:<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<br>You’ll get a competitive salary, unlimited time off, a flexible schedule, the ability to work wherever you want, a personal development budget, federal holidays and multiple weeks off at the end of the year to recharge. If you’re in the US, we also offer health insurance, disability and life insurance, and 401k matching.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>A little more about us:<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<br>Our team is made up of people who are passionate about the work they do, the clients they serve, and, importantly, their craft. We also care about each other — we don’t think of one another as coworkers or employees, but as fellow humans. From developers to designers, project managers to strategists, we bring out the best in each other.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br>We’ve been in business for over a decade, our whole team is remote, we were named a 2020 and 2021 Best Place to Work by the Inc. 5000 and the Washington Business Journal, and you can poke around our website if you want to know more. <br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>To apply:<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<br>If you’re interested, send an email to careers@yokoco.com with the subject line “Analyze This” — While you’re at it, we’d love to learn a bit more about you and get a link to your portfolio or see some of your work.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br>We take applicants from all over the world. However, you must be willing to work a schedule that has a reasonable overlap with normal US business hours. <br><br>

<div>
<a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior UX/UI designers (along with developers &amp; product folks) to team up with the hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. <br><br>After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.<br><br>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>High-paying, meaningful UX/UI design missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>How to apply:<br></strong>Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack</a> + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><strong><br>What you’ll do:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to be the lead designer for impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old-school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.</li>
<li>Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </li>
<li>You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Senior UX/UI Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.</li>
<li>Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.</li>
<li>The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>People looking for small gigs.</li>
<li>Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.</li>
<li>Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Our long-term vision:<br></strong><a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. </div><div>
<br>To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.</div>

<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</span> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </span>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Full autonomy:</span> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</span> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Keep 100% of what you earn: </span>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral" rel="nofollow">https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral</a> + mention Remotive. </span>No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.</p>

<ul style="padding-inline-start: 48px;">

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </span></p>
