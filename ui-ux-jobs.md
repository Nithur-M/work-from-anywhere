&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location: Remote - EMEA Team&lt;/strong&gt; (Open to applicants located anywhere aligned with EMEA time zones.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As a Senior UI Designer at 10up, you’ll work collaboratively alongside our Content and UX Design teams, and will lead UI design - expanding your portfolio - on award-winning, enterprise-level digital experiences.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You’ll have the creative flexibility to explore and experiment across design tools and processes on a combination of unique, challenging projects and ongoing support engagements. As a leading digital agency, 10up’s client roster spans from innovative startups and impactful non-profits, to some of the biggest names in the industry, such as ESPN, Google, The New York Times Co., Microsoft, and The Nobel Prize Committee.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As a 10upper, you have options for flexible and alternative work schedules. Intentionally remote since day one, spanning six continents and 40 countries, 10up fully embraces the benefits of distributed work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;What you will do:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partner with Project and Account Managers to plan design-related activities within project timelines and ideal project outcomes while mitigating risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be part of design workshops, discussions, and co-creation sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage in iterative, modular design production, documentation, and communication at various fidelity levels, such as visual concepts, style tiles, production style guides, user journeys, interactive prototypes, wireframes and layouts, high-fidelity comps, motion, animation definition, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with other disciplines on scope definition and design deliverables, fostering a psychologically safe collaboration and critique environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turning insights into actionable recommendations and design solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About you:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have 5+ years of experience working with modern website and app design principles across multiple devices - with a particular focus on layout, typography, color, media, and accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are equally comfortable with conceptual design and tactical design production in a fast-paced agency environment with effective time management. You have the ability to balance business, audience, and technical needs to drive positive design outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have clear and concise client communication skills, with the ability to confidently present design work with supporting rationale and compelling storytelling with confident workshop facilitation skills and co-creation mindset to define problems, ideate, and define solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are proficient with modern design, prototyping, remote collaboration tools (e.g., Figma and Miro), and come with interactive prototyping expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have systematic design thinking and expertise in creating modular component libraries and design systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience with large-scale content publishing or relevant adjacent expertise around designing for digital-first, editorial content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are able to work collaboratively within a diverse multidisciplinary team and efficiently manage design feedback from multiple stakeholders with an agility to adapt to various organizational working styles (e.g. agile, waterfall, lean etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are comfortable with ambiguity and have the ability to reduce it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You work in a timezone with at least 4-6 hours of overlap with the GMT timezone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expected hourly rate for this role is up to &lt;strong&gt;$60 USD&lt;/strong&gt; per hour. Compensation is determined based on a variety of factors including relevant experience, projects, geographic location, and business needs.&lt;/p&gt;
