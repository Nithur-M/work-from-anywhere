                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Independent UX/UI Designers (along with developers &amp; product managers) to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</span> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </span>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Full autonomy:</span> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</span> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Keep 100% of what you earn: </span>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">How to apply:</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral" rel="nofollow">https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral</a> + mention Remotive. </span>No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">What you’ll do:</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and contribute.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of DApps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol (a continuation of Whisper).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception.&nbsp; Our team is currently 150+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.</span></p></div>

<p><strong>Please make sure you read the job description with care. We would love to hear your thoughts about our design principles as part of your application</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our organization is closely involved in a new community lead project, called Logos, and this role will enable you to focus on its development. Logos is a grassroots movement to provide trust-minimized, corruption resistant governing services and social institutions to underserved citizens. Logos’ infrastructure will provide a base for the provisioning of the next-generation of governing services and social institutions - paving the way to economic opportunities to those who need them most, whilst respecting basic human rights through the network’s design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to promote the ideas behind Logos and its vision, we have created a brand studio called acid.info and you will be part of it. </span><a href="http://acid.info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acid.info</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the studio and creative engine within the Logos DAO.
