<strong>🐬 Fluyo is a startup looking for a legendary UX designer who will transform our well designed &amp; fun language learning app into an </strong><strong><em>incredibly</em></strong><strong> well designed &amp; even more fun app! Someone who through data/research, good intuition and design taste will level up our product user’s experience to the maximum level. <br></strong><br>
</div><div>Our mission at Fluyo is to make the world speak another language by making language learning truly fun. We combine the most effective language education with all the fun of a video game.</div><div><br></div><div>🧑‍🏫 <strong>Industry</strong>: Language Learning</div><div>🧑‍💻 <strong>Seniority</strong>: Mid/Senior (you will be the primary UX/UI designer in our team)</div><div>🏢 <strong>Company Size</strong>: 5 to 10 employees </div><div>
<strong>💰 Salary: </strong>€40k-55k EUR / $45k-60k USD per year</div><div>
<strong>📈 Equity: </strong>0.1 - 0.25% </div><div><br></div><div><strong>Perks</strong></div><div>-⏱ Flexible working hours (work whenever you want, but be available to chat during core hours: 8-11am EST / 2-5pm CET) </div><div>- 🌍 100% Remote working (our team is based in 7 different countries worldwide)</div><div>- 💰 Funded on Kickstarter (<strong>highest funded app in Kickstarter history!</strong>)</div><div>- 🚀 Make a real difference (we are publicly launching in a few months, so this is a really exciting time to join!)</div><div>- 🐣 Be an early team member + equity (as the company grows, your role will grow, and so will all the rewards!)</div><div>- 😎 A chilled out team (we work hard, but we do not micromanage at all)</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Essential Skills</strong></div><ul>
<li>Deep experience with Adobe XD or Figma, and an elegant, modern portfolio</li>
<li>Your files, components, prototypes and designs are very organized (and you can show this)</li>
<li>You love learning new languages and are familiar with the current most popular language learning apps</li>
<li>You love talking to customers/users to get product feedback and can turn this feedback into designs</li>
<li>You possess a strong intuition for what you believe users would like based on your own experience (not solely relying on research &amp; data)</li>
<li>You absolutely love UX, and constantly think about how your designs will affect user happiness and success</li>
<li>Fluent English (our employees speak many languages, but at work we speak English)</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Bonus Skills</strong></div><ul>
<li>You enjoy working closely with developers to ensure your designs are implemented correctly </li>
<li>Experience in game design or extensive gaming experience (the majority of Fluyo is either a game or very gamified, we need someone who is familiar with common gaming mechanics)</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>The Role</strong></div><div>You will be the main product designer in the team, and will be responsible for taking our current (slightly messy) XD file and transforming it into a professional, modern UI kit &amp; design. You will then be responsible for collecting and analyzing user feedback from our app, to determine what features users want added or improved, and then you will determine their feasibility and turn them into prototypes (and then full designs).<br><br>
</div><div>You will be responsible for anything that users interact with (and how they exactly interact with) on the app. We want someone who is bright, hard working and has a great user experience and visual design taste. We want someone who can take charge over our product and envision all the potential ways our product’s user experience can be improved, design said improvements and work with our developers to ensure your designs are matched and do QA. Please add the word “Goldshire” to your application so we know you read this post completely. Ultimately, the goal of this role is to help make our app an absolute joy for our customers to use.<br><br>
</div><div>Essentially, we need someone who is a professional and talented designer, but also someone who cares deeply about products and customers, and is always thinking about how to make our product more useful/enjoyable. </div><div>This is a full time requirement (approx. 7 hours per day) for 1 designer. Please no agencies. We want someone who can commit to our team and focus exclusively on this. We are not looking for a freelancer who has multiple projects on at the same time.  </div><div><br></div><div><strong>Our Company</strong></div><div>We're a language learning app that will completely change the way people learn languages. We're making a language learning app that is truly fun and addictive. It’s not simply “a gamified app”, it’s an actual game. A game that has been designed from the ground up to also be the most effective language learning system that’s ever existed. Other apps can be effective, but often are not truly fun and are very difficult to use consistently. Hence users rely on forcing themselves to use them. <br><br>
</div><div>In contrast, our app inspires excitement, acts as a platform for learners to make friends, is extremely fun, easy to use consistently and therefore makes one’s language learning journey so much better. We just became the most funded app on Kickstarter ever, and you can see our campaign and learn more about our product here: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/550782470/fluyo">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/550782470/fluyo</a>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Interview Process</strong></div><ul>
<li>Application form (below)</li>
<li>We review your portfolio, if we think you are potential fit, we’ll send you a small paid design / user flow critique test</li>
<li>Video call with CTO &amp; CEO</li>
<li>Decision made in early May</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Thanks so much for checking out our job! We can't wait to read your application and (hopefully) welcome you to our team! Even if this job is not a good fit for you, we will keep your contact details and email you about future jobs that fit your profile. We are going to be hiring a lot in 2023! </strong></div><div><img src="https://codahosted.io/docs/DOfhk1myD2/blobs/bl--4oQBr2VM2/234912ebcdfc86095b68b033e4cb14564d36c5a78ae59943480ac7a5b5bc985eaac4dba0d067aa2c44346b91ef0b04092b741388414eafa89ed9d1a312f0052c990bb977d7ff8be46f0b2c988255addb4e51edca970a1126c9f2d7ca8d8d044487b7e356" width="820" height="360"></div><div><br></div>

<div>
<a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior UX/UI designers (along with developers &amp; product folks) to team up with the hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. <br><br>After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.<br><br>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>High-paying, meaningful UX/UI design missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>How to apply:<br></strong>Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack</a> + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><strong><br>What you’ll do:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to be the lead designer for impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old-school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.</li>
<li>Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </li>
<li>You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Senior UX/UI Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.</li>
<li>Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.</li>
<li>The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>People looking for small gigs.</li>
<li>Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.</li>
<li>Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Our long-term vision:<br></strong><a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. </div><div>
<br>To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.</div>

<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</span> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </span>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Full autonomy:</span> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</span> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Keep 100% of what you earn: </span>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral" rel="nofollow">https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral</a> + mention Remotive. </span>No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">What you’ll do:</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </span></p>
