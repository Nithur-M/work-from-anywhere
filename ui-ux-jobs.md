<div><strong>The Company </strong></div><div> </div><div>At Springboard, we’re on a mission to bridge the world’s skills gap, offering transformative online education in data science, UI/UX design, machine learning, and coding. Our courses may be tech-enabled, but we're ultimately human-centric: each student taps into a vast community throughout their time with us, engaging with fellow students, industry-expert mentors, student advisors, and career coaches, the goal of which is to successfully transition students into their dream job. Through this hybrid approach, we’ve helped thousands of learners revamp their careers and, by extension, their lives, with hundreds of top-notch job offers received every year and a near-perfect placement rate for our program graduates.</div><div>
<br><strong>The Opportunity</strong>
</div><div> </div><div>Springboard runs an online, self-paced UI/UX Design Career Track in which participants learn with the help of a curated curriculum and 1-1 guidance from an expert mentor. Our mentor community is the biggest strength of our programs with a Net Promoter Score rated as world class.</div><div> </div><div>If you are as passionate about mentoring as you are about UX and UI, and can give a few hours per week in return for an honorarium, we would love to hear from you.</div><div> </div><div><strong>What does mentoring mean at Springboard?</strong></div><div> </div><div>Mentoring encompasses many levels of support at Springboard. We believe in giving a personalized approach to mentoring students. What this looks like is grading student deliverables on a weekly basis, offering detailed feedback, teaching/modeling concepts that are challenging for students, and/or giving them career pointers about the industry. Depending on your mentees you’ll lean on a teaching approach, being a motivator, advisor, or you may have high level conversions to guide them throughout the course. A mix of diverse students, skills, and abilities offers opportunities to renew your skills or take your skills to the next level.

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Independent UX/UI Designers (along with developers &amp; product managers) to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</span> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </span>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Full autonomy:</span> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</span> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Keep 100% of what you earn: </span>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
