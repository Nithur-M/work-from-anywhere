                <p>Judo is searching for a talented Mobile UI Designer who is excited by the idea of joining a company that builds a powerful tool for other designers.</p>
<p><strong>About Judo:</strong></p>
<p>Judo empowers designers to design and build apps without code.</p>
<p>With Judo's Mac app, designers can build app UIs using the same frameworks as a developer, but through the use of a visual canvas instead of writing code. Judo helps designers fully imagine and envision what's possible, by putting them in the driver's seat and giving them complete control from concept to completion.</p>
<p>The output from Judo is more than a static image and more than a prototype—it is a fully functional app UI that is ready to be shipped to users instantly, without having to submit to the App/Play store.</p>
<p>Judo's iOS and Android SDKs are installed in close to 100 different apps reaching millions of users. Some of our customers include DraftKings, Cabela's, Chicago Bulls and New England Patriots.</p>
<p>We're backed by the same group that funded Shippabo, Airtable, LaunchKit and more (TenOneTen and Freestyle VC), a top U.S. accelerator as well as several prominent angel investors. We've built a solid reputation with several major sports franchises as clients, and are now charting new territory as we explore the multitude of other industries who could benefit from incorporating Judo into their native app workflows.</p>
<p>Our name derives from the martial art, a key principle of which is “maximum efficiency with minimal effort”. This concept is captured in our mission to enable product teams to build faster and iterate more frequently.<br><br><strong>About our team:</strong></p>
<p>We're a group of humans who believe that we're our most creative and most innovative when we have the flexibility to determine where and when we work. We're 100% remote and hire talented folks from all over the world. Currently we have team members based in Canada, Brazil, Scotland, South Korea, Spain and Poland. We're intentional about remote culture, and believe that meaningful connections and effective collaboration with teammates aren't only possible in a remote environment - but that they're crucial for organizational success.</p>
<p>Things move quickly around here. Judo is a fast-paced, self-directed, energetic environment where everyone is bringing a fiery passion to work every single day. We value hustle, balance, innovation, customer obsession, design-centricity and continuous learning. We're entrepreneurial in spirit, creative in our thinking, and experimental in our approach.</p>
<p><strong>About the role:</strong></p>
<p>As a Mobile UI Designer at Judo, you will contribute directly to Judo's iOS and Android apps, helping to enhance the look, feel and usability of apps that are used by other designers, mobile product teams and engineers. </p>
<p><strong>What will you do as a Mobile UI designer at Judo?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a member of the product team, you'll be the lead designer for Judo's iOS and Android apps</li>
<li>Collaborate to build a holistic user experience and bridge overlapping functionalities between Judo's features and platforms </li>
<li>Iterate on design solutions and ideas based on feedback from colleagues, customers and data insights</li>
<li>Work closely with the  Engineering Team to implement your designs</li>

<li>Some programming experience is ideal. This could be HTML/CSS, JavaScript or Swift! We're looking for a tech-savvy designer who can demonstrate their interest and ability to get their hands dirty when it comes to code.</li>
<li>An interest and/or experience with SwiftUI. Judo's visual design tool is based on SwiftUI so you'll need to understand it to be able to design for it.   </li>
<li>An extensive understanding of Figma including auto-layout and variants. Bonus points if you've ever worked on tooling that uses Figma's API!</li>
<li>Ability to balance great design solutions with an iterative approach</li>
<li>Strong understanding of human-centered design, visual design, UX strategy, prototyping, interaction design, user research, and user adoption</li>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Independent UX/UI Designers (along with developers &amp; product managers) to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</span> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </span>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Full autonomy:</span> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</span> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;">Keep 100% of what you earn: </span>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
