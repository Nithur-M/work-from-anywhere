<div><em>Are you good at analyzing UX on websites using heuristics? Do you like discussing the smallest of UX details?</em></div><div><br></div><div>We’re seeking a full-time remote UX Auditor for our auditing team.</div><div><br></div><div>Baymard Institute is an independent e-commerce UX research organization – beyond conducting our own large-scale research studies for Baymard Premium, we also conduct client-specific work in the form of ‘UX Audits’.</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>-- <strong>The Job --</strong>
</div><div><br></div><div>As a UX Auditor, you will be responsible for conducting client-specific<a href="https://baymard.com/audits/site-element"> UX audits</a>, 90% of the job will be:</div><ul>
<li>Analyzing the UX of some of the world’s largest e-commerce sites – this is performed as an extremely detailed heuristic evaluation using a proprietary system and workflow, where Baymard’s research catalog of 700+ e-commerce UX parameters is used as the weighted heuristic (anchoring the audit in solid UX research).</li>
<li>Identifying and prioritizing findings for the client site into a set of suggestions for improvement.</li>
<li>Writing it all into a 50-150 page report and presenting it to the client in a 2-hour video conference call.<br><br>
</li>
</ul><div>Depending on your qualifications, other roles will be possible over time.</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div><strong>-- Qualifications --</strong></div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for the following qualifications for this role:</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>(7/7) Firm understanding of UX and user behavior</strong> – in this role, you will <em>not</em> conduct usability testing yourself with end-users, but rather be performing heuristic evaluations – analyzing the UX of a website across Baymard’s 700+ parameters/heuristics. This will require a firm understanding of UX and user behavior. Having experience with performing usability testing (remote or in-person testing) will be a plus (but is not a strict requirement).</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>(6/7) Finding attention to detail exciting</strong> – in each audit, we analyze the client site across 700 UX parameters, each of these 700 parameters then has 4-7 defined implementation nuances the audit must account for. This requires an extreme level of attention to detail and excitement for exploring the smallest of UI nuances of a site. Our best auditors know all 700 parameters, and most of the nuances within, by memory.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>(5/7) Rigor over time</strong> – while the typical audit project lasts just around 2 weeks (and you’ll, therefore, work for a new and interesting e-commerce site roughly every 2nd week) – the auditing <em>process</em> itself and the underlying UX research dataset doesn’t change that much. So the UX Auditor role requires that you have a high degree of stability and will find it exciting to look for the same set of 700+ e-commerce UX nuances all year round (although obviously applying that dataset to a very wide variety of sites and clients).</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>(4/7) Ability to communicate UX in writing</strong> – the primary deliverable for an auditor is the 50-150 page audit report. As the audit report relies on the foundation of Baymard’s vast catalog of UX research findings, but at the same time is a bespoke consulting project – you as an Auditor have to be good at accurately describing complex flows and user behaviors in writing. The audit reports are often read by a team with diverse backgrounds (managers, UXers, designers, and developers) – they all need to understand the described UX issue in just 4 paragraphs of text.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>(4/7) Comfortable with client presentations</strong> – while audits are never presented in-person at the client offices (due to global clients and somewhat short projects), the audit report deliverable is always followed up with a 2-hour conference call where you will be sharing your screen, walking the client through the audit report and key findings. Prior experience with client meetings and an ability to (correctly) answer general questions on anything related to e-commerce UX will be a plus but is not a requirement. Full fluency in spoken English is a requirement; other language skills are a plus.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>(2/7) Good understanding of web-jargon</strong> – being able to describe the differences between ‘auto-complete’, ‘auto-fill’, and ‘auto-correct’ on the spot will be a necessity when presenting and discussing your findings with a diverse set of clients.</div><div><br></div><div>Each of the above qualifications is weighted, 7 is the highest.</div><div><br></div><div>
<em>(Note that this is </em><strong><em>not a UX Designer or a UX Researcher job</em></strong><em>. At Baymard, we don’t perform any kind of client design work. If you are looking for a UX designer role, this role is not for you. If you are looking for a job where you will be performing a lot of direct usability testing with end-users, this role as a UX Auditor is not for your either (but do sign up for our </em><a href="https://confirmsubscription.com/h/y/CE3E7AE3F840C82E"><em>job alert</em></a><em> as we do hire UX Research Writers from time to time).</em>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div><strong>-- Other Job Specs --</strong></div><ul>
<li>Salary: in accordance with qualifications, but typically in the range of EURO 35,000-60,000 per year / USD 45,000-65,000 per year before taxes, contributions, etc., and with 25 days of annual paid time off (invoiced as a contractor — except for UK and IE residents where we are a registered employer).</li>
<li>Start date: as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Location: this is a remote full-time position.</li>
<li>Language: we expect you to be fully proficient in written and spoken English.</li>
<li>Travel: Is limited; expect only 0-1 week of optional travel each year (in connection with the optional, company-wide meetup).</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>-- How to Apply -- </strong></div><div><br></div><div>If you’re interested in this position, please apply by sending the following documents:</div><ol>
<li>A cover letter – describing how you fit the role and qualifications — and a link to your LinkedIn profile. <em>(1-2 page PDF. Required.)</em>
</li>
<li>A resume – describing your background and past experience. <em>(PDF. Required.)</em>
</li>
<li>Record a 1-2 minute video where you quickly present yourself. <em>(Required.)</em>
</li>
<li>Any samples or other documents; for example, heuristic evaluations you’ve performed, UX-related articles you’ve written, designs you’ve created, etc. <em>(Optional.)<br></em><br>
</li>
</ol><div>Send the above to <a href="mailto:info+auditor2022q4@baymard.com">info+auditor2023q3@baymard.com</a> (all applications and materials are treated confidentially).</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Deadline is July 24th, 2023 (end of day).</strong></div><div><br></div><div><em>Note: Based on the applications, a few selected candidates will be assigned a paid 10-hour hiring test, which will be the main evaluation criterion for the position. This will also be a good way for you to get a feel for the primary task of this job. (The test will be performed remotely. You’ll be given the task to audit a live website and describe your findings within a 10-day deadline.)</em></div><div>

<a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior UX/UI designers (along with developers &amp; product folks) to team up with the hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. <br><br>After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.<br><br>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>High-paying, meaningful UX/UI design missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>How to apply:<br></strong>Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack</a> + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><strong><br>What you’ll do:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to be the lead designer for impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old-school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.</li>
<li>Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </li>
<li>You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Senior UX/UI Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.</li>
<li>Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.</li>
<li>The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>People looking for small gigs.</li>
<li>Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.</li>
<li>Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Our long-term vision:<br></strong><a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. </div><div>
<br>To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.</div>
