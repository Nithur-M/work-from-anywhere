<br>Are you a <strong>UX designer </strong>who loves design so much that you simply need to <strong>share your passion</strong> with others? Can you <strong>create and produce educational content that is compelling, engaging and inspirational?</strong>  Are you excited by the <strong>incredible potential and impact of online learning</strong> and would you like to <strong>use your expertise to increase the global impact </strong>of a company that educates, empowers and supports its members to deliver the best user experiences? <br><br>
</div><div><strong>Great! Then, read on! </strong></div><div><br></div><div>The Interaction Design Foundation (IxDF) is the <strong>biggest online design school globally</strong>. We're <strong>market leaders</strong> in online design education because <strong>the world's leading experts create our content</strong>, and because we specialize in design. </div><div><br></div><div>We’re proud to say we’ve put together an <strong>amazing organization</strong> where people support, inspire, and challenge each other every day. Not only that, but we also get up each day to build a <strong>better future for millions of people</strong> around the world. </div><div><br></div><div>We’re<strong> primarily a remote company</strong> with around 50 employees, spread across 30 countries, and the Leadership team and founders are headquartered in Dubai.  We’re growing fast and are set on course to <strong>grow even faster</strong>. But something’s missing. And we think it could be you. </div><div><br></div><div>This is where your<strong> passion for learning merges with your desire to create the highest-quality education materials and experience, </strong>helping the IxDF to fulfill its vision to become <strong>the best,</strong> <strong>most well-known and most prestigious design school in the world</strong> and a one-stop destination for designers to learn new skills<strong>. </strong>We know that greatness does not come from casual effort. We can only achieve our wildly ambitious goals if we consistently turn ideas into results. That’s why we need you to help create the best products that help people become better designers. </div><h1>What will you be doing?</h1><div>Ahead of you is a <strong>highly rewarding and enriching journey</strong> on which you will make an impact as you:<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Help create and improve <strong>world-class educational materials</strong> on topics such as UX, UI, Design Thinking and more—in the form of highly engaging articles, videos, design templates, portfolio exercises, and much more.</li>
<li>Be passionately user-centric so that the content you create smashes the needs of our designer community.</li>
<li>Help <strong>push the quality</strong> of our educational materials to new heights—<strong>exceeding the very best in both industry and academia</strong>. </li>
<li>Participate in the editorial processes behind creating courses for tens of thousands of designers worldwide. You’ll work with some of the <strong>world’s best instructors</strong> and create, as well as edit, video-based and text-based online courses.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use your editorial skills</strong> to help your colleagues grow and become better communicators, educators and writers; just as they will help you.</li>
<li>Support IxDF content writers, community managers and social media teams to <strong>bring a real UX designer’s perspective to all dimensions of our content, marketing and communication</strong>.</li>
</ul><h1>About You</h1><ul>
<li>You have at least 3 years of experience working in UX/UI design and have a keen sense of communication. So, you have <strong>up-to-date knowledge of what UX designers need to learn, upskill and grow their careers</strong>. </li>
<li>You have your finger on the pulse of what the UX community likes to read, watch and learn about, and you have the content-creation skills to <strong>produce the kind of material that the community craves</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Communication is an art you live and breathe</strong>. You know how to reach into the lofty heights where abstract ideas live—and bring them down to “street level” so our students can hit the ground running with the valuable lessons you help them easily digest.</li>
<li>You are an <strong>expert wordsmith</strong> with an eagle eye for the tiniest details and a <strong>keen ear for flow</strong>. </li>
<li>You come up with ideas for visual content, such as video and graphics that will help make our content even more effective.</li>
<li>You are used to managing diverse responsibilities, and you are adept at dividing broad tasks into small, executable ones without losing sight of your overall goal. <strong>“Getting stuff done” is your middle name.</strong>
</li>
<li>You’re <strong>a practical idealist</strong>. You strive for perfection in everything you do, while understanding the delays that can come with waiting for something to be perfect. You know how to create great results through incremental quick wins and MVPs, and when to go all in to create something perfect.</li>
<li>You are <strong>results-driven</strong> and motivated by achievement and goals. <strong>Mediocrity gives you the chills</strong>.</li>
<li>You have experience translating design know-how into documentation or reference material for other designers, or for people outside the design world. </li>
<li>You know that you will only accomplish your goals <strong>through solid judgement, hard work and diligence</strong>.</li>
<li>You have <strong>strong social intelligence and empathy</strong>—and the ability to engage well with different types of people through writing.</li>
<li>You have a <strong>Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in User Experience</strong>, HCI, Information Technology, Communications or another related field—<em>or</em> you have enough industry experience in UI, UX and HCI.</li>
<li>
<strong>You speak and write in English with native fluency</strong>. And you can make your messages flow so well that whoever reads your work will be “right there” in the subject matter. As you know, the magic of any user experience is getting people to forget they’re even using a medium to reach you. </li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Bonus Points<br></strong><br>
</div><div>You get bonus points if you …<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Have experience as a design teacher, mentor, coach or facilitator.</li>
<li>Have your own blog or successful social media page where you create original content about UX and UI design.</li>
<li>Have contacts with, or ideas for top designers whom you think would be perfect for explaining their craft at IxDF.</li>
<li>Have strong opinions and thoughts on how you can make learning more engaging, fun and effective.</li>
<li>Have worked as an editor or created online courses.</li>
<li>Have experience with working remotely.</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>What can we offer?<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>A <strong>full-time position</strong>, within a remote first organization. </li>
<li>Work with a <strong>highly scalable business model </strong>where we’ve consistently created more than 50% growth year-on-year since 2013. Bootstrapped with zero investment capital but built purely on passion and consistency over time. </li>
<li>Work directly with the <strong>Director of Editorial where the distance between idea and execution is minimal.</strong>
</li>
<li>Work in a company culture where <strong>idealism meets high performance and excellence</strong>. You’ll need to be a practical idealist. As well-intentioned as they are, impractical idealists are counter-productive, whereas practical idealists make the world a better place.</li>
<li>Daily <strong>video-based contact</strong> with your colleagues from elsewhere on the planet, and you’ll get to meet them on team trips 1–2 times per year. </li>
<li>Work with people who have a <strong>hands-on attitude and a bias towards action</strong> as opposed to over-planning. </li>
<li>Get the <strong>satisfying responsibility of the full lifecycle</strong> from strategy and analysis all the way to execution. </li>
<li>Work in a <strong>highly agile organization with zero bureaucracy or corporate politics</strong> – but with a high level of orderliness and efficiency. </li>
<li>Have the chance to feel the impact of helping an ever-growing design education brand boost its outreach to <strong>empower and enrich the lives of many,  many more people</strong>. </li>

<a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior UX/UI designers (along with developers &amp; product folks) to team up with the hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. <br><br>After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.<br><br>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>High-paying, meaningful UX/UI design missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>How to apply:<br></strong>Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack</a> + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><strong><br>What you’ll do:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to be the lead designer for impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old-school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.</li>
<li>Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </li>
<li>You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Senior UX/UI Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.</li>
<li>Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.</li>
<li>The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>People looking for small gigs.</li>
<li>Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.</li>
<li>Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Our long-term vision:<br></strong><a href="https://build.a.team/wwrdesignerfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. </div><div>
<br>To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.</div>
