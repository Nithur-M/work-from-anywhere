<h2>Why this project?</h2>

<p>When I say work from anywhere, I mean it. My goal with this project is to curate best location independent jobs at one place. <br><br>There are multiple remote job boards out there. But most remote jobs allow the employees to work remotely from only a specific location. That's why I am building this repo. This repo is updated daily. I only want to curate the best quality jobs that's why I am going to stick with a handful of best remote job boards.</p>
