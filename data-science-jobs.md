                <p style="min-height:1.5em">Kindred is a members-only home swapping network that unlocks the ability to live a travel-rich lifestyle through the power of community. By exchanging primary residences with trusted peers, renters and owners alike can match with Kindred spirits and explore new destinations without breaking the bank.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We are on a mission to build a sharing economy that lives up to the name, and we’ve raised significant capital from some of the best investors in Silicon Valley, including Index Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, New Enterprise Associates, Bessemer Venture Partners, Caffeinated Capital, Elad Gil, and the founders of Opendoor, Figma, ClassPass, Clubhouse, Divvy, Gem, and Homebound.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">The co-founders are proven leaders from the early team at proptech company Opendoor ($15B+ exit) and have each separately built and scaled products that today do $1B+ annual revenue combined.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We’re looking for the world’s top builders, executors, and believers to join us on this ride.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">You can learn more about us in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bridgetarsenault/2022/06/10/a-new-home-swapping-platform-allows-you-to-travel-the-world-like-cameron-diaz-and-kate-winslet/?sh=203a5d0722cb">Forbes</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/19/opendoor-alums-raise-15m-for-kindred-a-home-swapping-network/">TechCrunch</a>.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>The Role:</strong></p><p style="min-height:1.5em">This role offers an exceptional opportunity to shape the future of Kindred by directly influencing our core business strategy—from growth to operations. You will collaborate closely with a top-tier team of executives and engineers to tackle some of Kindred’s most complex challenges, including optimizing the credit economy, balancing inventory, and refining dynamic pricing. We’re looking for someone who thrives both as a hands-on individual contributor and leader, capable of diving deep into complex problems while building a world-class data science team.
