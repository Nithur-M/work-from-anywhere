                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOB DESCRIPTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Science Actuary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counterpart is an insurtech platform reimagining management and professional liability for the modern workplace. We believe that when businesses lead with clarity and confidence, they become more resilient, more innovative, and better prepared for what’s ahead. That’s why we built the first Agentic Insurance™ system — where advanced AI and deep insurance expertise come together to proactively assess, mitigate, and manage risk.

Join us in shaping a smarter future, helping businesses Do More With Less Risk®.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Continuously challenge how we can improve our underwriting and operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a clean production environment such that the data models can be easily interpreted and built upon by other data science and engineering team members&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work from Anywhere&lt;/strong&gt;: Counterpart is a fully distributed company, meaning there is no office. We allow employees to work from wherever they do their best work, and invite the team to meet in person a couple times per year.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COUNTERPART&#39;S VALUES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conjoin Expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;- it is the cornerstone of autonomy. Ensure you are aware of what is expected of you and clearly articulate what you expect of others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speak Boldly &amp;amp; Honestly&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the only failure is not learning from mistakes. Don’t cheat yourself and your colleagues of the feedback needed when&amp;nbsp; expectations aren’t being met.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Entrepreneurial&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;- control your own destiny.&amp;nbsp; Embrace action over perfection while navigating any obstacles that stand in the way of your ultimate goal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Omotenashi&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(“selfless hospitality”) - trust will follow.&amp;nbsp; Consider every interaction with internal and external partners an opportunity to develop trust by going above and beyond what is expected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hold Nothing As Sacred&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;- create routines but modify them routinely.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Take the time to reflect on where the business is today, where it needs to&amp;nbsp; go, and what you have to change in order to get there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Wellness&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;- some things should never be sacrificed. We create an environment that stretches everyone to grow and improve, which is fulfilling, but is only one part of a meaningful life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our estimated pay range for this role is $160,000 to $180,000. Base salary is determined by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, market data, location, internal equitability, and experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to being a welcoming and inclusive workplace for everyone, and we are intentional about making sure people feel respected, supported and connected at work—regardless of who you are or where you come from. We value and celebrate our differences and we believe being open about who we are allows us to do the best work of our lives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are an Equal Opportunity Employer. We do not discriminate against qualified applicants or employees on the basis of race, color, religion, gender identity, sex, sexual preference, sexual identity, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, military status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law, rule, or regulation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
