<div>
<br><br>We are looking for a passionate and sharp Backend Engineer to be a part of one of our cross-functional product development teams to help us shape the future of the time tracking industry and deliver real value to our customers with both new and improved features.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br>Gross annual compensation range for the role is <strong>€63,000</strong> and we are committed to increasing salaries every year based on company and individual performance. In addition to that, we also have awesome benefits, which you can check out below.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br>You can work <strong>from anywhere in the world.<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>About the Team<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are a global team of 100+ awesome people working from over 40 countries around the globe. We hire globally, you work locally—in the heart of London, a beach outside of São Paulo, or a quiet village near Florence, the choice is yours. Every few months we travel to meet up somewhere in the world and spend some quality time together. We place a huge amount of trust in our people, and we measure the outcomes rather than the work itself. <a href="https://toggl.com/culture/">Our values</a> fuel our results.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>The Role<br></strong><br>
</div><div>As a Backend Engineer, you will be taking ownership of one or more domains of our product and will work closely with other engineers and product designers in lean ways using cutting-edge technologies powering highly-available RESTful services and back-end systems.<br><br>
</div><div>The main technologies you will be working with are Go, PostgreSQL and Google Cloud Infrastructure.<br><br>
</div><div>Even though you can work whenever you want on your tasks, <strong>our team meetings can happen between 11:00 to 15:00 UTC.</strong> You need to be willing and available to attend these meetings when they happen.<br><br>
</div><div>Your main responsibilities will be:</div><ul>
<li>developing, scaling and maintaining some of our backend services including the API, reports and other infrastructure services that manage our product and logistics worldwide</li>
<li>working with multiple teams day to day to bring more value to Toggl’s users, covering customer-facing web and native applications and public APIs</li>
<li>completing small to medium features independently and in collaboration with frontend engineers</li>
<li>resolving most technical issues autonomously and designing well-organized code</li>
<li>driving assigned requests to improve the codebase, such as migrating it to modern frameworks and adding missing tests</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>About you<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We would love to hear from you if you are passionate about technology and you are experienced with or willing to learn programming in Go.<br><br>
</div><div>In particular, we are looking for:</div><ul>
<li>Strong backend engineering experience in any language</li>
<li>Passion for cross-discipline collaboration and problem-solving</li>
<li>Eagerness to learn new skills, and take ownership of your work</li>
</ul><div>Bonus points for:</div><ul>
<li>Experience with our main technologies: Go, PostgreSQL and Google Cloud Infrastructure</li>
<li>Experience with software engineering best practices (e.g. unit testing, code reviews, design documentation)</li>
<li>Experience with system architecture, particularly at scale</li>
<li>Experiences with Kubernetes</li>
</ul><div><strong><br>Benefits</strong></div><ul>
<li>Freedom to choose when and how much you work - we only measure results</li>
<li>24 days of paid time off a year, plus your local holidays</li>
<li>In-person meetups for team-building (expenses covered)</li>
<li>4-6 weeks paid sabbatical (depending on the tenure)</li>
<li>Laptop budget up to €2,500 and it renews every 3 years</li>
<li>€2,000 budget to set up your home office, and additional €300 every year after 3 years of tenure</li>
<li>€250 per month for co-working space membership and/or internet service at home</li>
<li>€4,000 per year contribution to use for training, workshops, and conferences</li>
<li>€2,000 per year contribution for any equipment or services to improve and/or maintain your physical and mental health</li>
<li>Support for buying tools you need for doing your best work (even eyeglasses if you need a new pair)</li>
</ul>
