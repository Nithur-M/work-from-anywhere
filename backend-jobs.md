<h3><strong>Company Values</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Thinking in possibilities</strong><span style="font-weight:400;">: We realize that most see the world in terms of what is not possible. We believe the future is made by those who see what </span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">is</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;"> possible. Seeing a path of possibilities requires intellectual curiosity, dedication, and diligence. We are big thinkers and believers but also pragmatists, focused on relentless execution.</span></p>
<p><strong>Integrity of word, thought, and action</strong><span style="font-weight:400;">: Integrity is what is behind our words, thoughts, and </span><span style="font-weight:400;">actions. We help ourselves and others to stay true to why we do things so we can align, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">together, for the highest purpose.</span></p>
<p><strong>Diversity of perspectives:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> A good discussion is one that ends with all participants feeling </span><span style="font-weight:400;">that the other participants understood them, even if they had different ideas. This requires trust, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">vulnerability, and compassion. We believe organizations where people can truly co-create will </span><span style="font-weight:400;">thrive.</span></p>
<p><strong>Winning with purpose: </strong><span style="font-weight:400;">We are mission focused and realize that winning is a requirement to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">achieve lasting change that benefits everyone. Even though we love to compete, we understand that winning is not the same as success, but is needed to succeed.</span></p>
<p><strong>Ownership is key:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> When we own our successes, failures, best qualities, and flaws, we can truly work in a team, as a team. Ownership unlocks greatness as a team because it </span><span style="font-weight:400;">enables us to support and be supported.</span></p>
<p><strong>The excellence of being:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> Excellence is an expression of beingâof what we want for ourselves </span><span style="font-weight:400;">and others. It is passion turned into action. We share a desire to learn and excel while being </span><span style="font-weight:400;">comfortable with failing. Excellence comes when weâre courageously open about what we </span><span style="font-weight:400;">desire for this world.</span></p>
<p><strong>Unity in consciousness:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> We understand that we are all one. We are all working towards moving humanity forward in unique ways. We firmly believe that there is infinitely more that unites us than divides us, and our work is to bring that out in the world.</span></p>
