The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it.¬†</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we‚Äôve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we‚Äôve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we‚Äôre just getting started.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We've helped more than 20,000 people in need (see our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com">6,000+ five-star reviews</a>) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We just closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast ‚Äî our team grew from 52 to 91 last year and we expect to grow again in 2024.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus works in an industry dominated by outdated technology that is ripe for fresh thinking: our core competitors rely on massive call centers to screen clients, antiquated CRMs to track and manage cases, and paper checks to get paid (provided they‚Äôre sent to the right address).¬†</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Conversely, as a VC-backed tech company our product &amp; engineering department powers everything we do: from creating an engaging online experience for people in crisis to providing tools for our network lawyers as they serve our clients, Atticus relies on technology to fulfill our mission. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We‚Äôre looking for Software Engineers to join our team. You‚Äôll work on the back-end, and will partner with every department at Atticus as we continue to grow our platform in an effort to help people in need find trusted legal support.¬†¬†</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2><strong>What You'll Do:</strong></h2><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Design, build and operate Atticus‚Äô APIs with a focus on performance, modularity, extensibility, and reliability.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Work with product to evaluate and refine product details and acceptance criteria</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Architect, design, write, review, and test code in a collaborative environment with other software engineers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Evaluate storage technologies and methodologies with an eye toward scalability and performance.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Leverage your peers as multipliers for your skills to create excellent products and services.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">The role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup that doubles as a B-corp social enterprise.
