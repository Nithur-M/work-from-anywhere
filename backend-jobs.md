                <h2> <strong>About Atticus</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">At any given time, 16 million Americans are experiencing a crisis that requires urgent help from our legal system or government. The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus works in an industry dominated by outdated technology that is ripe for fresh thinking: our core competitors rely on massive call centers to screen clients, antiquated CRMs to track and manage cases, and paper checks to get paid (provided they’re sent to the right address). </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Conversely, as a VC-backed tech company our product &amp; engineering department powers everything we do: from creating an engaging online experience for people in crisis to providing tools for our network lawyers as they serve our clients, Atticus relies on technology to fulfill our mission. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We’re looking for Software Engineers to join our team. You’ll work on the back-end, and will partner with every department at Atticus as we continue to grow our platform in an effort to help people in need find trusted legal support.  </p><h2><strong>What You'll Do:</strong></h2><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Design, build and operate Atticus’ APIs with a focus on performance, modularity, extensibility, and reliability.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Work with product to evaluate and refine product details and acceptance criteria</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Architect, design, write, review, and test code in a collaborative environment with other software engineers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Evaluate storage technologies and methodologies with an eye toward scalability and performance.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Leverage your peers as multipliers for your skills to create excellent products and services.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">The role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup that doubles as a B-corp social enterprise. Every project you take on will help clients in need get the help they deserve, and you’ll shape our company culture as we scale. We’re looking for engineers who are excited about our mission and the challenges it entails.</p><h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">Required:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have 5+ years of experience writing idiomatic JavaScript, Golang, Java, Python, Scala, or Ruby.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You build modern, resilient and operationally sane backend systems exemplifying industry standards (HTTP REST, GraphQL, Stream processing, Big Data).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You enjoy teaching and mentoring teammates on backend system best practices and architecture</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You work well with product to clarify and translate requirements for teammates</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You use a modern version-control system for your source code repository (Git, Mercurial, GitHub, BitBucket).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You lint all your code or know you should.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You know what parts of your code require tests and you write those tests.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You use objective judgment in leveraging the right frameworks and technologies.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are versed in cloud computing systems (GCP, AWS, etc.) and SAAS concepts.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You leverage continuous integration systems to their full extent (CircleCI, Bamboo, Jenkins, TravisCI).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You plan for, build, evolve and scrutinize monitoring and alerting for your production systems.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are willing and able to deploy, troubleshoot, and maintain your systems in production and staging environments.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">Bonus / Nice-to-Have:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience with Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, CircleCI, Git, Golang, Java</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience with GraphQL, GraphQL Federation, REST APIs and supporting network protocols</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience with a distributed SQL platform like CockroachDB or Google Spanner</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience with Hadoop, MapReduce, or other “Big Data” systems</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.</p><h2><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">15 vacation days &amp; ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">401(k) and optional HSA/FSA</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $170,000 to $200,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p>

For cash compensation, we set standard ranges for all US based roles based on function, level and geographic location, benchmarked against similar stage growth companies. In order to be compliant with local legislation, as well as to provide greater transparency to candidates, we share salary ranges on all job postings regardless of desired hiring location. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including geographic location as well as candidate experience and expertise, and may vary from the amounts listed above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
