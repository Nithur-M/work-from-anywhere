<h3><strong>Company Values</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Thinking in possibilities</strong><span style="font-weight:400;">: We realize that most see the world in terms of what is not possible. We believe the future is made by those who see what </span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">is</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;"> possible. Seeing a path of possibilities requires intellectual curiosity, dedication, and diligence. We are big thinkers and believers but also pragmatists, focused on relentless execution.</span></p>
<p><strong>Integrity of word, thought, and action</strong><span style="font-weight:400;">: Integrity is what is behind our words, thoughts, and </span><span style="font-weight:400;">actions. We help ourselves and others to stay true to why we do things so we can align, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">together, for the highest purpose.</span></p>
<p><strong>Diversity of perspectives:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> A good discussion is one that ends with all participants feeling </span><span style="font-weight:400;">that the other participants understood them, even if they had different ideas. This requires trust, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">vulnerability, and compassion. We believe organizations where people can truly co-create will </span><span style="font-weight:400;">thrive.</span></p>
<p><strong>Winning with purpose: </strong><span style="font-weight:400;">We are mission focused and realize that winning is a requirement to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">achieve lasting change that benefits everyone. Even though we love to compete, we understand that winning is not the same as success, but is needed to succeed.</span></p>
<p><strong>Ownership is key:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> When we own our successes, failures, best qualities, and flaws, we can truly work in a team, as a team. Ownership unlocks greatness as a team because it </span><span style="font-weight:400;">enables us to support and be supported.</span></p>
<p><strong>The excellence of being:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> Excellence is an expression of beingâof what we want for ourselves </span><span style="font-weight:400;">and others. It is passion turned into action. We share a desire to learn and excel while being </span><span style="font-weight:400;">comfortable with failing. Excellence comes when weâre courageously open about what we </span><span style="font-weight:400;">desire for this world.</span></p>
<p><strong>Unity in consciousness:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> We understand that we are all one. We are all working towards moving humanity forward in unique ways. We firmly believe that there is infinitely more that unites us than divides us, and our work is to bring that out in the world.</span></p>

                <p><strong> About Us </strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://close.com/" rel="nofollow">Close</a>, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals(faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of 50+ high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Our backend <a href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close" rel="nofollow">tech stack</a> currently consists of Python Flask web apps with our <a href="https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger" rel="nofollow">TaskTiger</a> scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documented <a href="https://developer.close.com/" rel="nofollow">public API</a> that our front-end JavaScript app consumes. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using AWS tools, Terraform, and Ansible. </p>

<p>At Close, everyone has a voice. We encourage transparency and practice a mature approach to the work-place. In general, we don’t have strict policies, we have guidelines.

<p> </p>
<p>We come from 16 countries located in 5 of the 7 continents -- looking at you Antarctica and Australia ;-) ….. We’re a collection of talented humans rich in diverse backgrounds, lifestyles, and cultures. Every year we meet up somewhere around the world to spend time with one another. These gatherings are an opportunity to strengthen the social fiber of our global community. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our team is growing in more ways than one - we’ve recently launched 17 babies (and counting!). Unanimously, our favorite and most impactful value is “Build a house you want to live in.” We strive to make decisions that are authentic for our people and help our customers become more successful. </p>
<p> </p>
