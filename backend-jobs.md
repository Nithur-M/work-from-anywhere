                PolicyFly empowers insurers to sell and manage specialty insurance in minutes instead of months. Every year, $200B of specialty insurance like Cyber, Flood, or Trucking is processed over email between agents and insurers. Itâs a slow, inefficient world where 55% of agents' time is spent on paperwork and it can take 30-90 days to get coverage.Â Our mission is to create a modern exchange for hard-to-insure things â connecting all parties to automate workflows and consolidate data. We are modernizing specialty insurance with software. Weâre already managing $70M in premium with leading insurers in both the US and UK markets.Â Weâre on the hunt for a talented Senior Backend Engineer that will help transform the ancient world of specialty insurance with robust, distributed systems and clean, backend API architectures. We are converting prior monolith architectures to microservices and rapidly adding various system integrations as the product matures.Think youâre a good fit?

With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals (faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of 50+ high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.</p>

Our data stores include MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like EKS, MSK, RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters.

                <p><strong> About Us </strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://close.com/" rel="nofollow">Close</a>, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals(faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of 50+ high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Our backend <a href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close" rel="nofollow">tech stack</a> currently consists of Python Flask web apps with our <a href="https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger" rel="nofollow">TaskTiger</a> scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documented <a href="https://developer.close.com/" rel="nofollow">public API</a> that our front-end JavaScript app consumes. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using AWS tools, Terraform, and Ansible. </p>
