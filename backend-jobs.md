<p>At <a href="https://close.com/" rel="nofollow">Close</a>, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals(faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of 50+ high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Our backend <a href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close" rel="nofollow">tech stack</a> currently consists of Python Flask web apps with our <a href="https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger" rel="nofollow">TaskTiger</a> scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documented <a href="https://developer.close.com/" rel="nofollow">public API</a> that our front-end JavaScript app consumes. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using AWS tools, Terraform, and Ansible. </p>
