                <p><strong> About Us </strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://close.com/" rel="nofollow">Close</a>, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals(faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of 50+ high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Our backend <a href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close" rel="nofollow">tech stack</a> currently consists of Python Flask web apps with our <a href="https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger" rel="nofollow">TaskTiger</a> scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documented <a href="https://developer.close.com/" rel="nofollow">public API</a> that our front-end JavaScript app consumes. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using AWS tools, Terraform, and Ansible. </p>

<p>At Close, everyone has a voice. We encourage transparency and practice a mature approach to the work-place. In general, we don’t have strict policies, we have guidelines. Work/life harmony is an important part of our business - we believe you bring your best to work when you practice self-care (whatever that looks like for you).   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We come from 16 countries located in 5 of the 7 continents -- looking at you Antarctica and Australia ;-) ….. We’re a collection of talented humans rich in diverse backgrounds, lifestyles, and cultures. Every year we meet up somewhere around the world to spend time with one another. These gatherings are an opportunity to strengthen the social fiber of our global community. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our team is growing in more ways than one - we’ve recently launched 17 babies (and counting!). Unanimously, our favorite and most impactful value is “Build a house you want to live in.” We strive to make decisions that are authentic for our people and help our customers become more successful. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Our application process was designed to promote equitable and unbiased hiring practices. We ask a small series of questions that are similar to what would be asked in the first interview. This helps us learn more about you right from the start so please be sure to answer each question thoughtfully. Each application will receive two screens by two different reviewers. Regardless of fit, you will hear back from us letting you know if we'll be moving forward. </em></p>
