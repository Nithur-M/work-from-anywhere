With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals(faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of 50+ high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.</div><div><br /></div><div>Our backendÂ <a class="postings-link" href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close">tech stack</a>Â currently consists of Python Flask web apps with ourÂ <a class="postings-link" href="https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger">TaskTiger</a>Â scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documentedÂ <a class="postings-link" href="https://developer.close.com/">public API</a>Â that our front-end JavaScript app consumes. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using AWS tools, Terraform, and Ansible.</div><div><br /></div><div>We open sourcing our code and ideas on <a class="postings-link" href="https://github.com/closeio">our GitHub</a> and on <a class="postings-link" href="https://making.close.com/">The Making of Close</a>, our behind-the-scenes Product &amp; Engineering blog.Check out our projects like <u><a class="postings-link" href="https://github.com/closeio/socketshark">SocketShark</a></u>, <u><a class="postings-link" href="https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger">TaskTiger</a></u>,<u><a class="postings-link" href="https://github.com/closeio/limitlion">LimitLion</a></u> and <u><a class="postings-link" href="https://github.com/closeio/ciso8601">ciso8601</a></u>.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2><strong>About You</strong></h2><div>We're looking for an experienced full-time (or part-time) Software Engineer to join our engineering team.
