<div><strong>About Secfix</strong></div><div>Secfix automates security compliance for SMBs in Europe. We help companies get and stay compliant with standards such as ISO 27001, GDPR, TISAX, and SOC 2 in weeks rather than months. </div><div>Our platform integrates with a company’s tech stack (such as GCP, AWS, Azure, Google Workspaces, Jira, Gitlab, etc.), automatically extracts the data needed for compliance, and creates a checklist to become and remain certified. Our fastest customer finished their certification in 4 weeks instead of 12+ months, typically seen from older institutions.</div><div>We raised pre-seed funding from top German angel investors and recently closed our seed round from leading UK and German VCs after impressive growth. Now, the goal (with your help) is to become the market leader.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>About the role:</strong></div><div>As a small team, we are all generalists and constantly picking up new challenges. Regarding product and code, we’re looking to work with experienced people who can pick a problem and solve it. We use TypeScript and want to build more scalable systems so we can continuously make progress on a solid foundation. We don’t expect you to have a background in everything we use but expect strong JavaScript/Typescript fundamentals and a background working Java or another object oriented programming language are helpful. Every feature that is being ideated will go through you, and every future back-end engineer hire will live the engineering values that you will shape with us and live by. You'll get first-hand exposure to what it means to build and scale a remote software startup.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Preferred experience &amp; culture:</strong></div><ul>
<li>You love iterating and taking pride in owning customer-facing features from ideas to going live and strive for great visuals and usability. </li>
<li>You are a team player and communicate with other members and set up calls with customers if necessary to get feedback directly.</li>
<li>You have 7+ years of experience as back-end engineer</li>
<li>Strong object-oriented programming fundamentals working with either Node.js, Nest.js or Java. Experience working with TypeScript for 3+ years in back-end development. We don’t expect you to have a background in every technology we use but you are able to learn quickly on your own.</li>
<li>Experience with Golang are a plus</li>
<li>In our current growth stage, we want to achieve a lot with a small team. Priorities can change fast. Hence you are a strong believer that hard work and flexibility are qualities that an early startup employee should live by. You can pick up a customer problem, define it, and work on it. </li>
<li>You love speed and have high standards in writing clean, maintainable, and testable code.</li>
<li>You have 3+ years of experience in a fast-paced tech environment, startup, or scale-up where engineers wear multiple hats and define the products together with users. </li>
<li>You are a force multiplier for your team. You always catch up with new back-end trends, love building reusable components, and helping other engineers become better day by day.</li>
<li>You can communicate and structure your thoughts well both inside and outside of your team to ensure we ship products in time without getting lost in details.</li>
<li>You have experience in mentoring junior developers or leading a small team.</li>
<li>You have experience in working and improving remote team culture.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Responsibilities</strong></div><ul>
<li>You’ll design, develop, and maintain new user-facing features using Nest.js</li>
<li>You’ll help out, debug and support our clients looking into the code of our legacy API in Java</li>
<li>You’ll contribute to new and existing products by shaping features with product and design teams. </li>
<li>You’ll help build monitoring services for our customer’s infrastructure and cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure, Digital Ocean, etc)</li>
<li>You’ll help to design and develop event-driven microservices</li>
<li>You’ll mentor and develop junior engineers to help them become expert Secfixers</li>
<li>You’ll keep learning new technologies to improve our product and will structure complex product in simple deliverables</li>
<li>You’ll redefine best-in-class software development processes so that we can build an opinionated product for the European SMB market.</li>
<li>You’ll work closely with founders, tech lead, other team members, and users to ship features on schedule</li>

<li>We create trust within our organisation. Transparency and ethics are within our DNA.</li>

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Timescale helps developers build the next wave of computing, through its managed cloud-native platform for supercharged PostgreSQL. Scale further, build faster, spend less.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Do you love great developer experiences? Databases? Modern cloud infrastructure?&amp;nbsp; Are you excited to help build the next great database cloud, supporting a fully self-service product experience built around a high-degree of automation and scale?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We&#39;re looking for experienced backend engineers to help us design and build the backend microservices, APIs, and other software infrastructure for Timescale Cloud, which is built primarily in Golang. You’ll have the opportunity to work with a close-knit, experienced team.&amp;nbsp; You’ll design clean microservices and interfaces that will interact both with upstream and frontend APIs and interact with our Kubernetes-based clusters and infrastructure.&amp;nbsp; You’ll care about developing great user experiences for developers and believe that cloud engineering teams should own their products from design to implementation to operation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While you’ll help build services serving thousands of customers, it’s still Day 1 here at Timescale.&amp;nbsp; You’ll have the opportunity for significant impact and ownership.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Timescale is a 100% remote organization, with engineers throughout the world. For team effectiveness, this open role is primarily for those in North/South American and European timezones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Contribute to the growth and success of Timescale Cloud.&amp;nbsp; You will bring your experience, passion, and commitment to building a great database cloud experience for developers worldwide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Develop in Go, but you can up-level those skills while here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Work collaboratively with your team and other Timescalers to succeed together. You view communication as a critical part of your job (including both brainstorming random ideas and&amp;nbsp; providing more structured design and code review feedback).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ensure that Timescale Cloud remains reliable, scalable, and flexible as we continue to grow, and take the responsibility for hosting customers’ mission-critical databases seriously&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Strong programming skills (we mostly use Go but are more concerned with good fundamentals)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Experience building backend microservices and API-driven development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
