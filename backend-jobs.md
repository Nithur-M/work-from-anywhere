<div>The basics<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>The <strong>stack</strong>: Postgres, Node.js/Express.js, React. Currently running on Heroku, eventually AWS</li>
<li>The <strong>product</strong>: We're building the first subscription intelligence platform that empowers finance teams to get real-time snapshots of how their subscription business is performing!</li>
<li>The <strong>way we work</strong>:<ul>
<li>This is a <strong>remote job</strong> - work anywhere you want, and in any timezone on earth (or outside earth, whatever).</li>
<li>We are an <strong>asynchronous</strong> team - we don't do scheduled meetings, and rely on each team member to pick their own schedule and to communicate clearly in writing and with recorded videos. <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/1b92593aaf5f41abb2450869085dc3a5"><strong>Hear from our co-founder Michelle Lee on what it's like to work asynchronously (click here)</strong>.</a>
</li>
<li>We operate completely <strong>autonomously</strong> - no one will tell you what to do, we'll just tell you the goals and you will figure out how to work towards them with the rest of the team.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>role you'll play</strong> on our team:<ul>
<li>You'd be one of the <strong>first seven</strong> engineers on the team.</li>
<li>You'll <strong>work on</strong><ul>
<li>Backend: database design and implementation, complex data management problems, API design and implementation, writing tests</li>
<li>Frontend: building features in our react app, HTML/CSS + styled components, building amazing user experiences, writing tests</li>
<li>Frontend and backend: building and iterating on our product, collaborating with designers and founders, and making a product that users will love.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Like all start-ups we're scrappy, but not scrappy on compensation: Subscript is committed to paying our awesome team members at <strong>market-rate, including benefits.</strong>
</li>
</ul><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Our interview process<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Our interview process is designed to focus on <strong>your skills</strong> as a software engineer, and your ability to <strong>communicate clearly</strong>. We're a fully asynchronous company, so that's how we will communicate in this interview process too ðŸ™‚.<br><br>
</div><ol>
<li>We'll ask you to work on a small code challenge</li>
<li>After reviewing the short code challenge, we'll ask you to work on a <strong>~90 minute exercise </strong>while recording a loom (or other screen recording) video.</li>
<li>If the video interview above goes well, we'll want to learn a bit more about <strong>how you communicate in writing</strong> - we will ask you to put together a <strong>technical design document</strong>. This is one of the biggest ways we communicate at Subscript, so we want to see that you can work well with that!</li>
</ol><div>And finally, hopefully we'll send you an offer. And hopefully you'll accept!<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Requirements<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>You're an excellent engineer (you write high quality code, you write great tests, you ship quickly)</li>
<li>You're a great communicator via writing, and via recorded videos.</li>
<li>You're excited about working on a globally-distributed and diverse team, in an incredibly unique culture where autonomy, accountability, and ownership are equally as valued as your skillset.</li>
<li>That's it!</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Benefits<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Unlimited vacation</li>
<li>Completely flexible work schedule - work literally anytime (and anywhere) you want!</li>
<li>Benefits appropriate to your location (health/dental/vision in the USA)</li>
<li>Company wide retreats multiple times per year</li>
<li>Like all start-ups we're scrappy, but not scrappy on compensation: Subscript is committed to paying our awesome team members at market-rate, including benefits.</li>

            <p>Hi, weâ€™re DuckDuckGo, the Internet privacy company for everyone who wants to take back their privacy now. For over a decade, we've been building our all-in-one product, developing new privacy technology, and working with policymakers to make online privacy simple and accessible for all. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our app is now downloaded more than 78M times a year, and our private search engine packaged with it has become the #2 search engine on mobile in the United States and 18 other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands. Oh, and we've been profitable since 2014, with revenue exceeding $100 million a year! Now, weâ€™re rolling out a suite of new privacy solutions, including <u><a href="https://www.spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/" rel="noopener">Email Protection</a></u>,  <u><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-app-tracking-protection/%20" rel="noopener">App Tracking Protection</a></u> and our first-ever Desktop Apps for <u><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-duckduckgo-for-mac/" rel="noopener">Mac</a></u><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-duckduckgo-for-mac/" rel="noopener"> </a>and Windows.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Weâ€™re looking for a <strong>Senior Backend Engineer </strong>to help shape our all-in-one privacy solution and join our mission to show the world that protecting your privacy online can be simple.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong> </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In this role, you will lead complex projects across key company-wide objectives, writing pragmatic, testable code that's performant and works consistently.

<p><strong>What You Will Bring to DuckDuckGo</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>7+ years backend engineering experience, having worked on the backend side of at least one large application.</li>
<li>A fundamental understanding of complex data structures and algorithms. You can develop and apply new solutions and confidently navigate and improve existing code. If you're curious, we mostly use Perl.</li>
<li>A creative approach to problem-solving. You like to take the initiative to push a project forward but know when to get others involved.</li>
<li>Effective project management skills.</li>
