<strong>Senior Backend Engineer<br></strong><br>
</div><div>$120k – $150k<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>As a senior backend developer at <a href="https://baremetrics.com/">Baremetrics</a>, you will be working on a variety of projects from payment provider integrations and data ingestion to metrics processing and user-facing features.<br><br>
</div><div>We're a very small team with a huge bias for simplicity. You'll be working on projects, large and small, from inception to completion.<br><br>
</div><div>We approach our work with focus and purpose in an environment of trust and autonomy. When we work on a difficult problem, we take the time to think through and research the possible solutions and then write an implementation plan. Sometimes that may also include some tinkering.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>The stack you’ll use<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Baremetrics is built atop Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, and uses VueJS and Typescript on the frontend. You should feel comfortable exploring and learning new technologies and languages.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>The work to be done<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We have interesting engineering challenges and exciting plans for the future of the product, much of which revolves around processing and finding insights in large data sets.<br><br>
</div><div>Here are some examples of the type of problems you would work on:<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Implement new user-facing product features</li>
<li>Investigate metric discrepancies reported by customers and fix them at the root cause</li>
<li>Develop tooling to surface business insights across many terabytes of data</li>
<li>Mentor junior programmers</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>About you<br></strong><br>
</div><div>You have a strong track record of shipping great products using Ruby on Rails. You understand the language in depth. You should also be experienced in SQL query optimization and designing efficient schemas, as that's a big part of our core business logic.<br><br>
</div><div>We expect you to be self-motivated and self-directed, a strong individual contributor, and a true "manager of one".  Much of our communication happens in writing. It is important that you are a good writer and effective communicator.<br><br>
</div><div>
