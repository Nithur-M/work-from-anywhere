                <h3> </h3><h1><strong>About Atticus</strong></h1><p style="min-height:1.5em">At any given time, 16 million Americans are experiencing a crisis that requires urgent help from our legal system or government. The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We've helped more than 20,000 people in need (see our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com">6,000+ five-star reviews</a>) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We just closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 52 to 91 last year and we expect to grow again in 2024.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus works in an industry dominated by outdated technology that is ripe for fresh thinking: our core competitors rely on massive call centers to screen clients, antiquated CRMs to track and manage cases, and paper checks to get paid (provided they’re sent to the right address). </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Conversely, as a VC-backed tech company our product &amp; engineering department powers everything we do: from creating an engaging online experience for people in crisis to providing tools for our network lawyers as they serve our clients, Atticus relies on technology to fulfill our mission. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We’re looking for Software Engineers to join our team. You’ll work on the back-end, and will partner with every department at Atticus as we continue to grow our platform in an effort to help people in need find trusted legal support.  </p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2><strong>What You'll Do:</strong></h2><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Design, build and operate Atticus’ APIs with a focus on performance, modularity, extensibility, and reliability.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Work with product to evaluate and refine product details and acceptance criteria</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Architect, design, write, review, and test code in a collaborative environment with other software engineers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Evaluate storage technologies and methodologies with an eye toward scalability and performance.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Leverage your peers as multipliers for your skills to create excellent products and services.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">The role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup that doubles as a B-corp social enterprise. Every project you take on will help clients in need get the help they deserve, and you’ll shape our company culture as we scale. We’re looking for engineers who are excited about our mission and the challenges it entails.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">Required:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have 5+ years of experience writing idiomatic JavaScript, Golang, Java, Python, Scala, or Ruby.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You build modern, resilient and operationally sane backend systems exemplifying industry standards (HTTP REST, GraphQL, Stream processing, Big Data).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You enjoy teaching and mentoring teammates on backend system best practices and architecture</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You work well with product to clarify and translate requirements for teammates</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You use a modern version-control system for your source code repository (Git, Mercurial, GitHub, BitBucket).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You lint all your code or know you should.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You know what parts of your code require tests and you write those tests.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You use objective judgment in leveraging the right frameworks and technologies.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are versed in cloud computing systems (GCP, AWS, etc.) and SAAS concepts.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You leverage continuous integration systems to their full extent (CircleCI, Bamboo, Jenkins, TravisCI).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You plan for, build, evolve and scrutinize monitoring and alerting for your production systems.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are willing and able to deploy, troubleshoot, and maintain your systems in production and staging environments.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h3><strong>Bonus / Nice-to-Have:</strong></h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience with Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, CircleCI, Git, Golang, Java</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience with GraphQL, GraphQL Federation, REST APIs and supporting network protocols</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience with a distributed SQL platform like CockroachDB or Google Spanner</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience with Hadoop, MapReduce, or other “Big Data” systems</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">15 vacation days &amp; 16 paid holidays each year</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$1,000/year reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work </p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">401(k) and optional HSA</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Free snacks, drinks, weekly lunches, and regular team dinners/events/retreats</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $170,000 to $200,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

Tens of thousands of teams have made the switch to Pitch, including top brands like Intercom, Superhuman, and Notion.&amp;nbsp;And we’re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitch has grown fast and as a result we’d like to improve the way our users and organisations interact with the product as groups or teams. As such, we would like to hire a backend developer with strong Identity and Access Management (IAM) experience to join our Engineering team. If you&#39;re interested in solving tangible problems and want to be part of a diverse, remote-first team of visionaries, we&#39;d love to hear from you!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;What you’ll get to do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architect and evolve IAM systems - Design and implement robust, scalable systems for managing users, teams, and organisations, as well as their interrelationships. Maintain and enhance existing systems to ensure optimal performance and reliability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a trusted IAM advisor - Serve as a go-to expert across the company, providing guidance and actionable recommendations on identity and access management best practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proactively address access challenges - Diagnose and resolve access-related issues swiftly, ensuring the reliability and security of identity and access management systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate across teams - Partner with non-technical teams to debug issues, maintain accurate and up-to-date documentation, and identify opportunities for new tools or improved workflows to support their needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Who we are looking for&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are an experienced backend developer with hard-earned production skills, preferably in Clojure, but we’re happy to help you learn if you have experience in other languages such as Python, Go, etc. If you have experience with a functional language - even better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have designed and implemented robust realtime systems with high availability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You ensure code quality and system security through automation, unit testing and structured code reviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are product oriented, combining thoughtfulness with pragmatism and a will to get stuff done. You are calm and focused under pressure - for example when fixing production-affecting bugs - and consider work-life balance essential for long-term happiness and productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You believe effective and successful work is made possible by clear and honest communication, with a shared understanding of the long-term vision and immediate next actions. When you don&#39;t fully understand something, you ask lots of questions and use the opportunity to learn and grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Auth0 would be a huge plus, if you&#39;ve worked with other systems like AWS IAM then that&#39;s also a plus.&lt;/li&gt;
