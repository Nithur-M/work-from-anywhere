                <p>Hi, we’re DuckDuckGo, the Internet privacy company for everyone who wants to take back their privacy now. For over a decade, we've been building our all-in-one product, developing new privacy technology, and working with policymakers to make online privacy simple and accessible for all.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Our browsers and extensions have been downloaded over 250 million times with our built-in private search engine, which has seen over 100 billion searches and is the 2nd largest search engine on mobile in the United States and 20 other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Poland, Italy, and Spain. Our private search engine is also 3rd in market share in the U.S. and over 15 major markets. Oh, and we've been profitable since 2014, with annual revenue exceeding $100 million!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The DuckDuckGo browser’s uniquely comprehensive privacy protections are used by tens of millions of people to protect their everyday online activities on <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-duckduckgo-for-mac/" rel="noopener">Mac</a>, <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/windows-browser-open-beta/" rel="noopener">Windows</a>, <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-privacy-browser-ios14/" rel="noopener">iOS</a>, and <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-app-tracking-protection/" rel="noopener">Android</a>, from searching to browsing, emailing, and more. We also offer <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/meetprivacypro/" rel="noopener">Privacy Pro</a>, a three-in-one subscription service that includes a VPN, Personal Information Removal, and Identity Theft Restoration.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We’re looking for a <strong>Senior Backend Engineer </strong>to help shape our all-in-one privacy solution and join our mission to show the world that protecting your privacy online can be simple.  <br /><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong> <br /></p>
<p>In this role, you will lead complex projects across key company-wide objectives, writing pragmatic, testable code that's performant and works consistently. You'll collaborate remotely with your peers and take responsibility for solving product issues impacting our all-in-one privacy solution, whether large or small. In time, you'll formally mentor other engineers, supporting their career growth and the growth of the Backend Team at DuckDuckGo.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>What You Will Bring to DuckDuckGo</strong> </p>
<ul><li>7+ years backend engineering experience, having worked on the backend side of at least one large application.</li><li>A fundamental understanding of complex data structures and algorithms. You can develop and apply new solutions and confidently navigate and improve existing code. If you're curious, we mostly use Perl.</li><li>A creative approach to problem-solving. You like to take the initiative to push a project forward but know when to get others involved.</li><li>Effective project management skills.</li><li>Excellent communication skills. You can validate and communicate your decisions clearly.</li><li>Previous experience leading and mentoring experienced engineers, supporting their career goals, and unlocking their potential.</li></ul>

You can seek additional leadership roles by being directly responsible for projects, taking ownership of areas of the company, developing and maintaining internal processes, or pursuing advisory roles. </li><li><strong>Work/Life Balance: </strong>Team members have the freedom and flexibility to organize their own work schedules. We want you to thrive both in and out of the office. We trust you to use good judgment and take the time off that you need to bring your best self to work.</li></ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We also offer paid parental leave, a co-working stipend, office setup reimbursement, and a wellness stipend.
