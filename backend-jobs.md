<p><strong>About the Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>MasteryPrep is assembling an onshore development team to work exclusively on "greenfield" initiatives. We are looking for talented software engineers to help us level the playing field in education by building the most effective test preparation available, bar none. We believe that the best way to build this experience is by creating a diverse team of people from different backgrounds, races, religions, genders, sexual orientations, ages, and experiences. The team we are building must be aligned to our core values of:</p>
<ul> <li> <strong>Go pro.</strong> Or go home. Get better than the best.</li> <li> <strong>Do right.</strong> Period.</li> <li> <strong>Make it happen.</strong> Excuses never built anything.</li> <li> <strong>Make it awesome.</strong> There is no equality without quality.</li> <li> <strong>Customers are forever.</strong> This company is for them.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>

Building great products is a highly collaborative effort, so it's essential that you are a team player with solid communication skills.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Success criteria:</strong><br></p>
<ul> <li>You work collaboratively and respectfully with cross-functional teams to design cutting edge education products that change the world</li> <li>You propose innovative and creative ideas to solve tough engineering challenges that scale</li> <li>You raise the bar on quality, testing, and performance to ensure the product reliably performs</li> <li>You help identify and implement best practices and standards throughout the code and our processes</li> <li>You own quality issues and failures and work to actively resolve them with a sense of urgency</li> <li>You constantly strive to build an inclusive, supportive, and positive work environment</li> <li>Security is a first-class concern for you—<em><strong>SecOps</strong> </em><strong><em>isn't an afterthought</em></strong> </li> </ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Our development environment:</strong></p>
<ul> <li>React</li> <li>Typescript</li> <li>Python</li> <li>Mocha</li> <li>Lerna</li> <li>GraphQL</li> <li>Cube.js</li> <li>Google Cloud</li> <li>Google Cloud Functions</li> <li>Google Firestore</li> <li>Google Identity Platform</li> <li>Google BigQuery</li> <li>Postgres</li> <li>GitLab</li> </ul>

<p><br></p>
<p><strong>What you will be building</strong></p>
<p>While support and maintenance for existing platforms may be required from time to time, this role will primarily focus on our "greenfield" initiatives. MasteryPrep is wholly committed to building cutting-edge technology solutions to level the playing field for education. Our platform has to scale to support interactions in hundreds of live classrooms with up to 250+ students in a single class. This is not a job for the faint of heart. However, if projects and challenges of this scale excite you, then you may be the right fit for the role.</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

                <p><strong> About Us </strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://close.com/" rel="nofollow">Close</a>, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals(faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of 50+ high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Our backend <a href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close" rel="nofollow">tech stack</a> currently consists of Python Flask web apps with our <a href="https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger" rel="nofollow">TaskTiger</a> scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documented <a href="https://developer.close.com/" rel="nofollow">public API</a> that our front-end JavaScript app consumes. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using AWS tools, Terraform, and Ansible. </p>

<p>At Close, everyone has a voice. We encourage transparency and practice a mature approach to the work-place. In general, we don’t have strict policies, we have guidelines.

<p> </p>
<p>We come from 16 countries located in 5 of the 7 continents -- looking at you Antarctica and Australia ;-) ….. We’re a collection of talented humans rich in diverse backgrounds, lifestyles, and cultures. Every year we meet up somewhere around the world to spend time with one another. These gatherings are an opportunity to strengthen the social fiber of our global community. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our team is growing in more ways than one - we’ve recently launched 17 babies (and counting!). Unanimously, our favorite and most impactful value is “Build a house you want to live in.” We strive to make decisions that are authentic for our people and help our customers become more successful. </p>
