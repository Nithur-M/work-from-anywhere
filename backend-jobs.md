&lt;li&gt;Conduct deep dives into problematic features, researching and analyzing their behavior to understand root causes and identify potential solutions. Develop hypotheses, run experiments, analyze results, and translate findings into actionable engineering improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct performance tuning, debugging, and testing of backend systems to ensure reliability and efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foster a data-driven culture by sharing engineering best practices and collaborating on cross-functional projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This role includes participation in a shared on-call rotation. The schedule will be communicated in advance, and we strive to balance coverage equitably while minimizing off-hours disruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentor junior developers, helping all team members grow in our mission, values and abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What you bring:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;6+ years of experience in backend development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong, demonstrated experience in GoLang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong experience in designing, developing, and maintaining scalable backend systems.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Proficiency with general software engineering tools: Git, IDEs, shell scripting, CI/CD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient in English for clear communication in a global, remote team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work independently on tasks while effectively collaborating as a team member.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nice to Have:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experience with infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practical experience with analytical storage systems like ClickHouse, Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, or Databricks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with observability tools like Datadog or other monitoring and logging platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of modern containerization and orchestration technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with working with large open-source projects to address the needs of a wide variety of stakeholders as well as to demonstrate the ability to work and communicate asynchronously across a world-wide team.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace.
