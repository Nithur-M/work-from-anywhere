&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We’re a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country. This is the dream that drove Wences Casares, our Founder and Chairman, to quietly transform the world of banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Although we are headquartered in Gibraltar, this is a full time, 100% remote position&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Position Overview:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a Technical Tribe Lead to join our engineering function. At Xapo, we are building truly cross-functional teams with full ownership of design, architecture, building, testing, delivery, data, and operations. You will lead and collaborate closely with fellow team members from the product, apps, design, and QA communities of practice.&amp;nbsp; You will be part of the Technical Leadership team and will be in charge of all the technical aspects of Xapo Bank products, and your focus will be on Assets Under Management products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Xapo Bank, we work in Tribes. Each Tribe focuses on a different aspect of providing value to our customers. The Assets Under Management Tribe is in charge of AUM-related products in our app &amp;amp; backoffice domains such as treasury, FinOps, etc. All this responsibility is split across multiple teams, working towards critical KPIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Technical Tribe Lead, you will provide guidance and coaching around technical good practices and play an active, key role in the Development Community of practice. You will closely lead your dedicated team of Engineers but also be the face of the AUM Tribe (Engineering).&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main tech stack includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support, coach, and develop team members into top-performing engineers, both on hard and soft skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support, coach, and develop Tech Leads into top performers, contributing to the success of their teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working closely in cross-functional teams where everyone is responsible for the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a great place to work for talented and motivated people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing, developing, and deploying backend services focusing on high availability, fault tolerance, low latency, and security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take full end-to-end responsibility for the services your team owns, from development to production, operations, and data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support other departments and scale non-technical teams through technical augmentation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skills needed:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experience building contract-first services and adopting patterns and frameworks to enable appropriate automated testing at the unit, contract, service, and end-to-end levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience building services that can be deployed on demand, quickly, and with quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent understanding of CI/CD patterns and good practice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Xapo, we prioritize consumer protection and adhere to regulatory requirements by ensuring that all Xapiens are accountable for upholding principles of fair treatment, transparency, and ethical conduct in their interactions with customers and stakeholders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
