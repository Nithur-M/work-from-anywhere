The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design, implement, and maintain robust backend services and APIs that support our customer dashboard, public-facing management APIs, and internal back-office tools, including billing and subscription lifecycle management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead and participate in technical and functional discussions, contributing to architectural decisions and owning backend components from design to deployment in a high-performing team environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, delivering high-quality backend solutions within fast-paced and sometimes time-constrained development cycles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work closely with product managers, designers, and frontend engineers to understand requirements, provide backend perspective, and ensure seamless integration of backend services with other systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This role includes participation in a shared on-call rotation. The schedule will be communicated in advance, and we strive to balance coverage equitably while minimizing off-hours disruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Build and enhance backend systems for real-time data processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foster a data-driven culture by sharing engineering best practices and collaborating on cross-functional projects.&lt;/li&gt;
