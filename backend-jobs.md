<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">At Flourish Labs, we’re on a mission to bring accessible, affordable mental health support to everyone who needs it by empowering people to support each other.

<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">We are growing the workforce of Certified Peer Supporters by training students in peer support skills, such as active listening, building rapport, strengths, self-care, coping strategies and safety.

Students who want support will be able to find Certified Peer Supporters in our network who match their needs, and book support sessions via our digital platform.</p>
