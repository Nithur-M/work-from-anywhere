<div><strong>About Secfix</strong></div><div>Secfix automates security compliance for SMBs in Europe. We help companies get and stay compliant with standards such as ISO 27001, GDPR, TISAX, and SOC 2 in weeks rather than months. </div><div>Our platform integrates with a company’s tech stack (such as GCP, AWS, Azure, Google Workspaces, Jira, Gitlab, etc.), automatically extracts the data needed for compliance, and creates a checklist to become and remain certified. Our fastest customer finished their certification in 4 weeks instead of 12+ months, typically seen from older institutions.</div><div>We raised pre-seed funding from top German angel investors and recently closed our seed round from leading UK and German VCs after impressive growth. Now, the goal (with your help) is to become the market leader.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>About the role:</strong></div><div>As a small team, we are all generalists and constantly picking up new challenges. Regarding product and code, we’re looking to work with experienced people who can pick a problem and solve it. We use TypeScript and want to build more scalable systems so we can continuously make progress on a solid foundation. We don’t expect you to have a background in everything we use but expect strong JavaScript/Typescript fundamentals and a background working Java or another object oriented programming language are helpful. Every feature that is being ideated will go through you, and every future back-end engineer hire will live the engineering values that you will shape with us and live by. You'll get first-hand exposure to what it means to build and scale a remote software startup.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Preferred experience &amp; culture:</strong></div><ul>
<li>You love iterating and taking pride in owning customer-facing features from ideas to going live and strive for great visuals and usability. </li>

<li>You have 7+ years of experience as back-end engineer</li>
<li>Strong object-oriented programming fundamentals working with either Node.js, Nest.js or Java. Experience working with TypeScript for 3+ years in back-end development. We don’t expect you to have a background in every technology we use but you are able to learn quickly on your own.</li>
<li>Experience with Golang are a plus</li>
<li>In our current growth stage, we want to achieve a lot with a small team. Priorities can change fast. Hence you are a strong believer that hard work and flexibility are qualities that an early startup employee should live by. You can pick up a customer problem, define it, and work on it. </li>
<li>You love speed and have high standards in writing clean, maintainable, and testable code.</li>
<li>You have 3+ years of experience in a fast-paced tech environment, startup, or scale-up where engineers wear multiple hats and define the products together with users. </li>
<li>You are a force multiplier for your team. You always catch up with new back-end trends, love building reusable components, and helping other engineers become better day by day.</li>
<li>You can communicate and structure your thoughts well both inside and outside of your team to ensure we ship products in time without getting lost in details.</li>
<li>You have experience in mentoring junior developers or leading a small team.</li>
<li>You have experience in working and improving remote team culture.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Responsibilities</strong></div><ul>
<li>You’ll design, develop, and maintain new user-facing features using Nest.js</li>
<li>You’ll help out, debug and support our clients looking into the code of our legacy API in Java</li>
<li>You’ll contribute to new and existing products by shaping features with product and design teams. </li>

<li>You’ll help to design and develop event-driven microservices</li>
<li>You’ll mentor and develop junior engineers to help them become expert Secfixers</li>
<li>You’ll keep learning new technologies to improve our product and will structure complex product in simple deliverables</li>
<li>You’ll redefine best-in-class software development processes so that we can build an opinionated product for the European SMB market.</li>
<li>You’ll work closely with founders, tech lead, other team members, and users to ship features on schedule</li>
