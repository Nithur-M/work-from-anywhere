<h3><strong>Company Values</strong></h3>

We believe the future is made by those who see what </span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">is</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;"> possible. Seeing a path of possibilities requires intellectual curiosity, dedication, and diligence. We are big thinkers and believers but also pragmatists, focused on relentless execution.</span></p>

<p><strong>Diversity of perspectives:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> A good discussion is one that ends with all participants feeling </span><span style="font-weight:400;">that the other participants understood them, even if they had different ideas. This requires trust, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">vulnerability, and compassion. We believe organizations where people can truly co-create will </span><span style="font-weight:400;">thrive.</span></p>
<p><strong>Winning with purpose: </strong><span style="font-weight:400;">We are mission focused and realize that winning is a requirement to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">achieve lasting change that benefits everyone. Even though we love to compete, we understand that winning is not the same as success, but is needed to succeed.</span></p>
<p><strong>Ownership is key:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> When we own our successes, failures, best qualities, and flaws, we can truly work in a team, as a team. Ownership unlocks greatness as a team because it </span><span style="font-weight:400;">enables us to support and be supported.</span></p>
<p><strong>The excellence of being:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> Excellence is an expression of beingâof what we want for ourselves </span><span style="font-weight:400;">and others. It is passion turned into action. We share a desire to learn and excel while being </span><span style="font-weight:400;">comfortable with failing.
