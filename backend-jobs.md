                <div class="h1">About Us</div>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Within the next decade, investing will be decentralized, democratized, and community-driven. Syndicate is building the infrastructure to enable this at scale—we’re developing decentralized investing and social networking protocols, advanced legal tech solutions, and a next-gen social networking platform that empowers communities to raise, coordinate, and invest capital like never before.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Founded in Jan 2021, we've raised over $20M from values-aligned leaders who represent a diverse array of industries and communities, including firms like Andreessen Horowitz and its Cultural Leadership Fund, IDEO CoLab Ventures, Variant, Electric Capital, and over 200 others. We've also partnered with and received investment from over 100 community partners.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Our first product allows anyone to start an investing syndicate on the Ethereum for just the cost of gas. The typical fees to set up an investing syndicate average $12,000 which allows us to be up to <strong>1,200x less expensive</strong> than traditional methods. We're using public blockchain technology to expand access to venture capital for entrepreneurs around the world because we believe that venture capital should be widely available rather than only accessible in a small handful of cities.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<div class="h2">We're a Remote-First Company</div>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">We're proud to be a globally distributed company that's remote forever. Many companies have had to adopt remote work, but you could say we were born into it. That keeps things simple and efficient—you can work from almost anywhere, without worrying about a commute, rigid schedule, or retrofitting old processes into new ways of working.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">We’ve built a top-notch remote culture that includes things like a home office stipend, travel reimbursement, and unlimited time off, regular in-person meetups around the world (including at least once a year where we fly the whole company out to a shared summit), and many more benefits to help you do your best work wherever you are.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">For most roles, we welcome applicants from anywhere in the world as long as the hours you choose overlap with the Pacific US timezone for meetings.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<div class="h2">Diversity and Inclusion</div>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">At Syndicate, we're building a fundamentally revolutionary product—one that promises to democratize finance in a way never before attempted. That starts with a diverse, inclusive, affirming, and welcoming team. We are deeply committed to these principles as a core value, and proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. If you're a member of an underrepresented or marginalized group, we strongly encourage you to apply.</p>
