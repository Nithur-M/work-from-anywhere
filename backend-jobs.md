Oh, and we've been profitable since 2014, with revenue exceeding $100 million a year! Now, we’re rolling out a suite of new privacy solutions, including <u><a href="https://www.spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/" rel="noopener">Email Protection</a></u>,  <u><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-app-tracking-protection/%20" rel="noopener">App Tracking Protection</a></u> and our first-ever Desktop Apps for <u><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-duckduckgo-for-mac/" rel="noopener">Mac</a></u><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-duckduckgo-for-mac/" rel="noopener"> </a>and Windows.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of our positions are fully remote. You do not have to relocate to join us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The position&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll be joining 100 engineers across Frontend, Backend, SRE and QA. We&#39;re organised into cross-functional development teams assigned to specific verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is open for several teams, and we will define the exact team that you will be joining during the interview process based on the business needs and your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the specific team, you will be working on building tools, APIs and integrations for one of our products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex and meaningful challenges — solving them will enable people and businesses to live and operate in any country of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity to have a significant impact on the business — we are still very early in our journey as a company, and each change you make today is amplified by the company&#39;s growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of freedom to organize your work and life —&amp;nbsp;you are not bound to daily standups, recurring meetings or other ceremonies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive salary, stock options, unlimited PTO and a set of perks and benefits.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote is solving global remote organizations’ biggest challenge: employing anyone anywhere compliantly. We make it possible for businesses big and small to employ a global team by handling global payroll, benefits, taxes, and compliance. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://remote.com/how-it-works&quot;&gt;remote.com/how-it-works&lt;/a&gt; to learn more or if you’re interested in adding to the mission, scroll down to apply now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take a look at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://remote.com/handbook&quot;&gt;remote.com/handbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to learn more about our culture and what it is like to work here. &lt;strong&gt;Not only do we encourage folks from all ethnic groups, genders, sexuality, age and abilities to apply, but we prioritize a sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/people-Belonging-Diversity-Equity-Inclusion-DEI-4990e36a7d7b4d52a78ca3efb23d718b&quot;&gt;belonging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; You can check out independent reviews by other candidates on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Remote-EI_IE3871683.11,17.htm&quot;&gt;Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt; or look up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/people-Candidate-Experience-Surveys-17d595a88b7548148593792a8072235f&quot;&gt;results of our candidate surveys&lt;/a&gt; to see how others feel about working and interviewing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of our positions are fully remote. You do not have to relocate to join us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The position&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll be joining 100 engineers across Frontend, Backend, SRE and QA. We&#39;re organised into cross-functional development teams assigned to specific verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is open for several teams, and we will define the exact team that you will be joining during the interview process based on the business needs and your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the specific team, you will be working on building tools, APIs and integrations for one of our products.&lt;/p&gt;

We use React and Nextjs for our front-end. Gitlab is used as a version control tool, issue tracker and a CI/CD solution. Our applications are hosted on AWS. We fully rely on our CI for deployments and deploy multiple times per day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What this job can offer you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex and meaningful challenges — solving them will enable people and businesses to live and operate in any country of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity to have a significant impact on the business — we are still very early in our journey as a company, and each change you make today is amplified by the company&#39;s growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of freedom to organize your work and life —&amp;nbsp;you are not bound to daily standups, recurring meetings or other ceremonies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive salary, stock options, unlimited PTO and a set of perks and benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A supportive and kind work environment where we would like you to challenge the dogmas and pursue innovation!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong team of experienced engineers who will support and facilitate your professional growth.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Basic knowledge and experience in Elixir and Postgres (or similar database)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in dealing with ambiguity, taking abstract concepts and turning them into working software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work independently and self-guided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiosity and willingness to learn and develop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working in HR- or Fintech projects is a plus&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote is solving global remote organizations’ biggest challenge: employing anyone anywhere compliantly. We make it possible for businesses big and small to employ a global team by handling global payroll, benefits, taxes, and compliance. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://remote.com/how-it-works&quot;&gt;remote.com/how-it-works&lt;/a&gt; to learn more or if you’re interested in adding to the mission, scroll down to apply now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of our positions are fully remote. You do not have to relocate to join us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The position&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll be joining 100 engineers across Frontend, Backend, SRE and QA. We&#39;re organised into cross-functional development teams assigned to specific verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is open for several teams, and we will define the exact team that you will be joining during the interview process based on the business needs and your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the specific team, you will be working on building tools, APIs and integrations for one of our products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote is solving global remote organizations’ biggest challenge: employing anyone anywhere compliantly. We make it possible for businesses big and small to employ a global team by handling global payroll, benefits, taxes, and compliance. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://remote.com/how-it-works&quot;&gt;remote.com/how-it-works&lt;/a&gt; to learn more or if you’re interested in adding to the mission, scroll down to apply now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of our positions are fully remote. You do not have to relocate to join us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The position&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll be joining 100 engineers across Frontend, Backend, SRE and QA. We&#39;re organised into cross-functional development teams assigned to specific verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is open for several teams, and we will define the exact team that you will be joining during the interview process based on the business needs and your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the specific team, you will be working on building tools, APIs and integrations for one of our products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote Compensation Philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote&#39;s Total Rewards philosophy is to ensure &lt;span class=&quot;discussion-id-cebb987a-9afd-4675-8d06-52ee02e2fd32 notion-enable-hover&quot; data-token-index=&quot;1&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;fair, unbiased compensation&lt;/span&gt; and fair &lt;a class=&quot;notion-link-token notion-enable-hover&quot; href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/remotecom/people-Belonging-Diversity-Equity-Inclusion-DEI-4990e36a7d7b4d52a78ca3efb23d718b#75466fcdedd04c909da6851605a4114c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-token-index=&quot;3&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-annotation-unknown-block-id-1572131788&quot;&gt;equity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pay along with competitive benefits in all locations in which we operate. We do not agree to or encourage cheap-labor practices and therefore we ensure to pay above in-location rates. We hope to inspire other companies to support global talent-hiring and bring local wealth to developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you’ll plan your day (and life)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work async at Remote which means you can plan your schedule around your life (and not around meetings). Read more at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.remote.com/async&quot;&gt;remote.com/async&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be empowered to take ownership and be proactive. When in doubt you will default to action instead of waiting. Your &lt;strong&gt;life-work balance&lt;/strong&gt; is important and you will be encouraged to put yourself and your family first, and fit work around your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like something you want, apply now!&lt;/p&gt;
