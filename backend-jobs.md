<strong>Senior Backend Engineer<br></strong><br>
</div><div>$140k+<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>As a senior backend developer at <a href="https://baremetrics.com/">Baremetrics</a>, you will be working on a variety of projects from payment provider integrations and data ingestion to metrics processing and user-facing features.<br><br>
</div><div>We're a very small team with a huge bias for simplicity. You'll be working on projects, large and small, from inception to completion.<br><br>
</div><div>We approach our work with focus and purpose in an environment of trust and autonomy. When we work on a difficult problem, we take the time to think through and research the possible solutions and then write an implementation plan. Sometimes that may also include some tinkering.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>The stack you’ll use<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Baremetrics is built atop Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, and uses VueJS and Typescript on the frontend. You should feel comfortable exploring and learning new technologies and languages.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>The work to be done<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We have interesting engineering challenges and exciting plans for the future of the product, much of which revolves around processing and finding insights in large data sets.<br><br>
</div><div>Here are some examples of the type of problems you would work on:<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Implement new user-facing product features</li>
<li>Investigate metric discrepancies reported by customers and fix them at the root cause</li>
<li>Develop tooling to surface business insights across many terabytes of data</li>
<li>Mentor junior programmers</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>About you<br></strong><br>
</div><div>You have a strong track record of shipping great products using Ruby on Rails. You understand the language in depth. You should also be experienced in SQL query optimization and designing efficient schemas, as that's a big part of our core business logic.<br><br>
</div><div>We expect you to be self-motivated and self-directed, a strong individual contributor, and a true "manager of one".  Much of our communication happens in writing. It is important that you are a good writer and effective communicator.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>The hiring process<br></strong><br>
</div><div>There are a few stages in the hiring process. We know how nerve-racking applying for a new job can be and we want to make it as smooth and enjoyable as possible. We're looking to make an offer to someone no later than September 30.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Stage 1: Initial application &amp; questions</strong> — You’ll send in your basic info and we’ll send over a few questions about your experience and skills.<br> <br>- <strong>Please send an email to allison@baremetrics.com introducing yourself and attach your resume!<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Stage 2: Interviews</strong> — You’ll have a video interview with someone on the engineering team. You’ll then do a final video interview with our CEO to talk about company culture, benefits, perks, and the future of the company as well as to answer any questions you have.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Stage 3: Job Offer</strong> — After consulting a few of your references, we’ll make an offer and hope that you’ll join the team!<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>Benefits<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Work from anywhere (we're 100% remote) but prefer a candidate that is located/works US timezones. </li>
<li>Competitive salary ($140,000+)</li>
<li>Flexible work hours</li>
<li>Full health, vision &amp; dental insurance for you and your family</li>

<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #555659; white-space: pre-wrap;">At <a class="postings-link" href="https://close.com/" rel="nofollow" style="color: #969799; text-decoration: underline;"><u style="background-color: inherit;">Close</u></a>, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals (faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of 50+ high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #555659; white-space: pre-wrap;">Our backend <a class="postings-link" href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close" rel="nofollow" style="color: #969799; text-decoration: underline;"><u style="background-color: inherit;">tech stack</u></a> currently consists primarily of Python Flask web apps with our <a class="postings-link" href="https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger" rel="nofollow" style="color: #969799; text-decoration: underline;"><u style="background-color: inherit;">TaskTiger</u></a> scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like EKS, MSK, RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documented <a class="postings-link" href="https://developer.close.com/" rel="nofollow" style="color: #969799; text-decoration: underline;"><u style="background-color: inherit;">public API</u></a> that our front-end JavaScript app consumes.

                <p><strong> About Us </strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://close.com/" rel="nofollow">Close</a>, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals(faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of 50+ high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Our backend <a href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close" rel="nofollow">tech stack</a> currently consists of Python Flask web apps with our <a href="https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger" rel="nofollow">TaskTiger</a> scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documented <a href="https://developer.close.com/" rel="nofollow">public API</a> that our front-end JavaScript app consumes. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using AWS tools, Terraform, and Ansible. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>At Close, everyone has a voice. We encourage transparency and practice a mature approach to the work-place. In general, we don’t have strict policies, we have guidelines. Work/life harmony is an important part of our business - we believe you bring your best to work when you practice self-care (whatever that looks like for you).   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We come from 16 countries located in 5 of the 7 continents -- looking at you Antarctica and Australia ;-) ….. We’re a collection of talented humans rich in diverse backgrounds, lifestyles, and cultures. Every year we meet up somewhere around the world to spend time with one another. These gatherings are an opportunity to strengthen the social fiber of our global community. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our team is growing in more ways than one - we’ve recently launched 17 babies (and counting!). Unanimously, our favorite and most impactful value is “Build a house you want to live in.” We strive to make decisions that are authentic for our people and help our customers become more successful. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Our application process was designed to promote equitable and unbiased hiring practices. We ask a small series of questions that are similar to what would be asked in the first interview. This helps us learn more about you right from the start so please be sure to answer each question thoughtfully. Each application will receive two screens by two different reviewers. Regardless of fit, you will hear back from us letting you know if we'll be moving forward. </em></p>
