                PolicyFly empowers insurers to sell and manage specialty insurance in minutes instead of months. Every year, $200B of specialty insurance like Cyber, Flood, or Trucking is processed over email between agents and insurers. Itâs a slow, inefficient world where 55% of agents' time is spent on paperwork and it can take 30-90 days to get coverage.Â Our mission is to create a modern exchange for hard-to-insure things â connecting all parties to automate workflows and consolidate data. We are modernizing specialty insurance with software. Weâre already managing $70M in premium with leading insurers in both the US and UK markets.Â Weâre on the hunt for a talented Senior Backend Engineer that will help transform the ancient world of specialty insurance with robust, distributed systems and clean, backend API architectures. We are converting prior monolith architectures to microservices and rapidly adding various system integrations as the product matures.Think youâre a good fit?

<strong>Senior Backend Engineer<br></strong><br>
</div><div>$140k+<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>As a senior backend developer at <a href="https://baremetrics.com/">Baremetrics</a>, you will be working on a variety of projects from payment provider integrations and data ingestion to metrics processing and user-facing features.<br><br>
</div><div>We're a very small team with a huge bias for simplicity. You'll be working on projects, large and small, from inception to completion.<br><br>
</div><div>We approach our work with focus and purpose in an environment of trust and autonomy. When we work on a difficult problem, we take the time to think through and research the possible solutions and then write an implementation plan. Sometimes that may also include some tinkering.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>The stack you’ll use<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Baremetrics is built atop Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, and uses VueJS and Typescript on the frontend. You should feel comfortable exploring and learning new technologies and languages.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>The work to be done<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We have interesting engineering challenges and exciting plans for the future of the product, much of which revolves around processing and finding insights in large data sets.<br><br>
</div><div>Here are some examples of the type of problems you would work on:<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Implement new user-facing product features</li>
<li>Investigate metric discrepancies reported by customers and fix them at the root cause</li>
<li>Develop tooling to surface business insights across many terabytes of data</li>
<li>Mentor junior programmers</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>About you<br></strong><br>
</div><div>You have a strong track record of shipping great products using Ruby on Rails. You understand the language in depth. You should also be experienced in SQL query optimization and designing efficient schemas, as that's a big part of our core business logic.<br><br>
</div><div>We expect you to be self-motivated and self-directed, a strong individual contributor, and a true "manager of one".  Much of our communication happens in writing. It is important that you are a good writer and effective communicator.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>The hiring process<br></strong><br>
</div><div>There are a few stages in the hiring process. We know how nerve-racking applying for a new job can be and we want to make it as smooth and enjoyable as possible. We're looking to make an offer to someone no later than September 30.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Stage 1: Initial application &amp; questions</strong> — You’ll send in your basic info and we’ll send over a few questions about your experience and skills.<br> <br>- <strong>Please send an email to allison@baremetrics.com introducing yourself and attach your resume!<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Stage 2: Interviews</strong> — You’ll have a video interview with someone on the engineering team. You’ll then do a final video interview with our CEO to talk about company culture, benefits, perks, and the future of the company as well as to answer any questions you have.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Stage 3: Job Offer</strong> — After consulting a few of your references, we’ll make an offer and hope that you’ll join the team!<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>Benefits<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Work from anywhere (we're 100% remote) but prefer a candidate that is located/works US timezones. </li>
<li>Competitive salary ($140,000+)</li>

<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #555659; white-space: pre-wrap;">At <a class="postings-link" href="https://close.com/" rel="nofollow" style="color: #969799; text-decoration: underline;"><u style="background-color: inherit;">Close</u></a>, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals (faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of 50+ high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.</p>

Our data stores include MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like EKS, MSK, RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documented <a class="postings-link" href="https://developer.close.com/" rel="nofollow" style="color: #969799; text-decoration: underline;"><u style="background-color: inherit;">public API</u></a> that our front-end JavaScript app consumes.

                <p><strong> About Us </strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://close.com/" rel="nofollow">Close</a>, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals(faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of 50+ high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Our backend <a href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close" rel="nofollow">tech stack</a> currently consists of Python Flask web apps with our <a href="https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger" rel="nofollow">TaskTiger</a> scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documented <a href="https://developer.close.com/" rel="nofollow">public API</a> that our front-end JavaScript app consumes. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using AWS tools, Terraform, and Ansible. </p>
<p> </p>
