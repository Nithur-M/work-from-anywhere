<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and contribute.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of DApps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol; the p2p communication layer for Web3.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception.&nbsp; Our team is currently 200+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.</span></p></div>

    <p class="p1"><strong>The role:</strong><br><br>Status Desktop is currently in beta for Mac, Windows and Linux platforms. Current product focus is on the privacy-centric messenger and group chat functionality, and we’ve just kicked off development of our new ‘multi-chain from the ground up’ crypto Wallet. &nbsp;ÐApp browser and blockchain node functionality will follow next. Status desktop is currently built using&nbsp;<a href="https://nim-lang.org/"><span class="s1">Nim</span></a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;QT for the frontend, and it shares a common backend with Status mobile that is written in Go. We are currently in the middle of a large refactor of our architecture. &nbsp;This refactor includes transitioning the QT front end from Nim to C++, moving all business logic to our status-go backend, and upgrading from QT5.14.2 to QT6.2. &nbsp;As we work in the open and are fully open source you can get a better idea of who we are and the work we are doing by browsing&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a href="https://hackmd.io/@status-desktop/main/%2FwAbKqYTdR_-FWLZZouSxsg"><span class="s1">team wiki here</span></a>&nbsp;and taking a look at our&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop"><span class="s1">Status Desktop</span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/status-im/statusQ"><span class="s1">Status Desktop QML component library</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/status-im/status-go"><span class="s1">Status Desktop and Mobile Go backend</span></a>&nbsp;GitHub repos.&nbsp; You can find more information about our desktop effort in this&nbsp;<a href="https://our.status.im/status-desktop-why-and-what/"><span class="s1">blog post</span></a>.&nbsp;</p>
