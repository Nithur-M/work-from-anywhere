A black hole for many, a goldmine for few. However, these bots should be leveraged by a lot more people, because, well, they frigging work wonders. ;-) While the early adopters have been mining cryptos since the beginning. HODLING their investments for the big win. You might still be HOLDING on to your traditional savings, thinking the crypto-ship has sailedÃ¢â¬Â¦</b></p><p><b>But hey ho, hell no. There is crypto-hope on the horizon. And we invite you to embark on our mission to simplify and clarify our Ã¢â¬ËmysteriousÃ¢â¬â¢ product. To all.

Take those shitcoins and run, kiddo!</b>ÃÂ </p><br><h1>Forecast: raining FOMO</h1><p>Do you ever trust the weatherman? Neither do we. But we do trust the unbeatable experts on our Cryptohopper team. And they predicted FOMO season is coming. Of course you may think this is a far-fetched prophecy. But weÃ¢â¬â¢ve been back-testing our gut feeling since the early days and we were rarely wrong. So. Buckle up. We prepare for storm.<br></p><br><h1>Android App Developer?</h1><p>Turn right if you want to develop an edge-of-your-seat app that creates an awesome experience for our traders. Prepare to snuggle up (currently not too closely) to our product teams, so you can build (and run, and love) the exact app our users need to trade on cryptocurrency markets. To succeed, you have to be versed in Kotlin and Java, and willing to get up close and personal with up-and-coming tooling. Including tech that you introduce to the stack. This is the perfect position if you combine Ã¢â¬ËhardcoreÃ¢â¬â¢ coding skills with a Ã¢â¬Ësecurity firstÃ¢â¬â¢ mindset and are excited to learn about crypto trading and blockchain technologies<br></p><br><h1>Hi, we're the stack.</h1><p>Kotlin and Java, JUnit, Truth,ÃÂ RESTful APIs, Git, Bitrise.</p><br><h1>You know you got this if.<br></h1><ul><li>You have 3+ years of experience as an Android Native app developer</li><li><p>You dream about Kotlin, Java, Android's design principles and application interface guidelines</p></li><li><p>Your lunch break experiments sometimes get out of hand. One time you accidentally developed an app that correlated caffeine intake with sock funkiness. And it worked<br></p></li><li><p>You have knowledge of automation and testing methodologies used for automated testing (JUnit, Truth), familiar with RESTful API's, offline storage, threading and perfomance tuningÃÂ </p></li><li><p>Proficient in code versioning tools such as Git and familiair withÃÂ push notifications, APIs, and cloud messaging</p></li><li><p>Experience with continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) solutions such as Bitrise</p></li>                </ul><br><h1>What we offer.</h1><p>A mission-driven culture with a great work/life balance and a good benefits package. Sure, we work hard to get sh*t done, but we also regularly push our moustache (sorry, itÃ¢â¬â¢s a silly joke for Dutch readers) for a VR gaming session, picnics in the park, indoor bouldering, drinks at the pub, live DJ sessions and whatever happens in our (wo)man cave - and probably best stays there. The setting aside, we also:</p><ul><li>Pay you (pinky promise!): between EUR 55K and 75K per year [skill dependent]</li><li>Allow you to work wherever, including 2 days at our Amsterdam HQ </li><li>Send you on your merry way for 25 days each year, minimum (more is negotiable)</li><li>Provide you with great gear; a high-end laptop and whatever else you need to succeed. Perhaps an AI-driven desk chair that *knows* when you want to lean back?</li><li>Lifetime Cryptohopper subscription (if you donÃ¢â¬â¢t break our BFF vows)</li><li>Shower you with extras, like trading benefits, a generous training budget, and (mom will be proud!) the opportunity to work in a domain that accelerates financial inclusion for the unbanked</li><li>Pour you a stiff drink on Fridays, coffee that wonÃ¢â¬â¢t make you wish you chose tea, and lots of mind-blowing feedback on your work, hobbyÃ¢â¬â¢s, and pets.

<strong>Pay</strong>: €100-140k+ per year, based on experience. </div><div> </div><div><strong>What the job will be like</strong></div><div>Your initial role will be to build out the MVP for this new advanced scraping toolset, working with a PM and reporting to our VP of engineering, leveraging existing systems designs and experimentation results. However, you will be writing the production code from a blank slate, and there will still be considerable experimentation and problem solving required as we work through the inevitable unexpected hurdles. <br><br>
</div><div>You’ll be primarily work on your own -- your VP and PM will help set direction and be available to brainstorm and provide suggested avenues of exploration. However, the more you can generate your own ideas, plans, and work independently, the better. Initial onboarding  will include daily check-ins, shifting to a 2/week cadence as you get settled.

We dont know how how to fix, but please, have lunch on us! We’ll send €20 to anyone that even submits a take home test. </div><div>
<strong> </strong> </div><div><strong>Application Submission</strong></div><div>If this sounds like the right job for you, please send your first and last name, resume, and 2 or 3 sentences for each of following questions to <a href="mailto:careers@kratzenpartners.com">careers@kratzenpartners.com</a> : </div><div> </div><div>1.     What’s your experience scraping internet data?</div><div>2.     What are hard-to-spoof ways to fingerprint what browser someone is actually using?</div><div>3.     Without using the ip address, how might you detect a web client is using a vpn?</div><div>4.     Are there more avenues of detection available if the client is using an https proxy?</div><div> </div><div>
<em>Please remember, THERE ARE NO WRONG ANSWERS to these question!</em> </div>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </span></p>

Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </span></p>
