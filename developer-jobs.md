<strong>About opesus<br></strong>
<p>We help companies become more sustainable by providing consulting and developing our own software products for SAP sustainability solutions. </p>

<p>Why do these industry giants trust a company with 35 employees?<br></p>
<p>Because we are outstanding in what we do.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Corporate Culture</strong>: Having worked at SAP, we wanted to work and live differently. Netflix said, “Let’s make the company we always dreamed of.” At opesus we are doing the same thing – our values, our mission, and how we interact with one another are all part of our corporate culture. The team weeks (twice per year) are a key component of that culture. Everyone from our most recent hire to the CEO comes together for a week of collaboration where we work and learn together, allow everyone’s voice to be heard, and have a lot of fun in the process! <a href="https://www.opesus.com/en/about-us/our-culture">Find out more about corporate culture</a>

<li>
<strong>Remote work</strong>: We love seeing each other in the office. But we also recognize that there are many paths in live and allow everyone to work remotely.</li>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="">
<li style=""><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li style=""><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>

    <p>We're looking for a Rust Developer to join our team to help innovate on our PostgreSQL projects.</p>
<p>You'll primarily collaborate with the PostgreSQL tools team and directly contribute to technical choices and internal processes.</p>
<p>The key tasks associated with this role revolve around Rust development in the PostgreSQL ecosystem. You will work to refine and expand our PostgreSQL extensions, develop CLI tooling for the dbdev package index, and assist in the development of several other repositories.</p>
<p>In this role, you will be mainly responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>contributing to our Rust repos:
<ul>
<li>Public Projects <a href="https://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql">pg_graphql</a>, <a href="https://github.com/supabase/dbdev">dbdev</a>, <a href="https://github.com/supabase/wrappers">wrappers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/supabase/pg_jsonschema">pg_jsonschema</a></li>
<li>Pre-Public Projects: e.g. an implementation of the PostgreSQL wire protocol</li>
<li>Internal repos</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>participating in the successful rollout of <a href="https://github.com/tcdi/plrust">pl/rust</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>This role requires three critical attributes:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have a strong background in Rust programming. You're well-versed in Rust's unique features and understand how to leverage them to create efficient, reliable software. You are comfortable making architectural decisions and navigating/contributing to large codebases.</li>
<li>Experience with PostgreSQL. While not strictly necessary, experience with PostgreSQL will be a significant advantage in this role. You may have previously worked with PostgreSQL extensions or used PostgreSQL in a high-performance context.</li>
<li>Ability to self-manage. Every company will expect you to self-manage to some degree, but Supabase takes this to a new level. We are a flat, early-stage startup without a lot of structure. To thrive in this environment, you’ll need to be a motivated self-starter who is good working asynchronously across multiple teams. We’re looking for someone who will identify things that need improvement and put their heads down until it’s shipped.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What you’ll do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute to the development of our Rust projects, refining existing features and developing new ones.</li>
<li>Participate in the design and development of our PostgreSQL extensions and package index.</li>
<li>Build tools within the Supabase ecosystem, occasionally dogfooding our own work.</li>
<li>Interacting with customers on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Triage and fix GitHub issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Must haves</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3+ years experience in Rust development.</li>
<li>Experience with Git and version control practices.</li>
<li>Willingness to evolve and shape our development tools/stack.</li>
<li>Willingness to regularly talk to customers to ensure we’re solving problems they have.</li>
<li>Willingness to work in a fast-paced environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nice to haves</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience with PostgreSQL as a user and/or extension author.</li>
<li>Experience with GraphQL.</li>
<li>Experience working on a large, open-source projects.</li>
<li>Open source rust contributions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We offer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>100% remote work from anywhere in the world. No location-based adjustment to your salary.</li>
<li>ESOP (equity ownership in the company)</li>
<li>Autonomous work. We work collaboratively on projects, but you set your own pace.</li>
<li>Health, Vision and Dental benefits. Supabase covers 100% of the cost for employees and 80% for dependents</li>
<li>Generous Tech Allowance for any office setup you need</li>
<li>Annual Education Allowance</li>
<li>Annually run off-sites.</li>
</ul>

    

    <div class="content-conclusion"><h3>BUILD IN A WEEKEND. SCALE TO BILLIONS</h3>
<p>Supabase adds auth, realtime, and restful APIs to Postgres without a single line of code.</p>
<p>Each project within Supabase is an isolated&nbsp;Postgres cluster, allowing customers to scale independently, while still providing the features that you need to build: instant database setup, auth, row level security, realtime data streams, auto-generating APIs, and a simple to use web interface.</p>
<p>We are a fully remote company.</p>
<p>Key Tech: Javascript, Typescript, Go, Elixir, PostgREST (haskell), Postgres, Pulumi.</p>
<h3><a id="about-the-team" class="anchor"></a>About the team</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're a startup. It's unstructured.</li>
<li>Collectively founded more than a dozen venture-backed companies.</li>
<li>More than 10 different nationalities.</li>
<li>We deeply believe in <a href="https://supabase.com/blog/2022/03/25/should-i-open-source-my-company" target="_blank">the efficacy of collaborative open source</a>. We support existing communities and tools, rather than building "yet another xx".</li>
<li>We "dogfood" everything. If you use it in your project, we use it in Supabase.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="process" class="anchor"></a>Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>The entire process is fully remote and all communication will happen over email or via video chat.</li>
<li>Once you've submitted your application, the team will review your submission, and may reach out for a short screening interview over video call.</li>
<li>If you pass the screen you will be invited to up to four follow up interviews. The calls:
<ul>
<li>usually take between 20-45 minutes each depending on the interviewer.</li>
<li>are all 1:1.</li>
<li>will be with both founders, a member of either the growth or engineering team (depending on the role), and usually one other person from your immediate team or function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the interviews are over, the team will meet to discuss several roles and candidates and may:
<ul>
<li>ask one or two follow-up questions over email or a quick call.</li>
<li>go directly to making an offer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
