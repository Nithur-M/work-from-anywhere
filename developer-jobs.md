                &lt;p&gt;Timescale is looking for a Developer Advocate to represent our products in technical communities around the world. A Developer Advocate is a developer’s best friend. We are engineers with experience building the kinds of systems we advocate for. We are leaders and earnest participants in the developer community. We care deeply about inclusion and providing a positive experience for all developers everywhere we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role will focus on Timescale pgvector, a powerful extension for PostgreSQL that allows for efficient similarity search using vector data. In this role, you’ll build amazing online content (articles, videos, blog posts) for Timescale and third-party developer sites and publications. You will create content and provide guidance on how to leverage pgvector for advanced data processing and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Timescale is a developer-first company. There will never be confusion in this role about whether or not we’re a developer company. We are, and we embrace it. You’ll also work in an organization where even the marketing people write code. We love developers, and you’ll fit right in if you love developers, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create content, videos, and samples from beginner to best practices demonstrating how to develop and work with Timescale, Postgres, and time-series data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create benchmarking content that zooms out to focus on the big picture, comparing more than just raw performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify external advocates and community leaders and support them as they discuss Timescale and time-series data independently of us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect and summarize customer feedback and relay it effectively to the product team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use data, experiments, and customer feedback to drive Timescale adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with AI and machine learning technologies, ideally in the context of PostgreSQL and time-series data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated ability to create and present content related to AI and its applications in data management and analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of AI and machine learning trends and the ability to translate them into valuable content and advocacy efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A self-starter who can manage and prioritize initiatives that will make developers successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with PostgreSQL is strongly preferred; it’s the backbone of our product, and we need you to be able to dive deep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industry experience with the type of data you’d use Timescale with. This could be anything but be prepared to cover it in your interview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous experience working with developers is highly desirable, but that could be as an advocate, an evangelist, a developer, or a solutions architect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience working with 3rd party communities, social media, and blogging is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A deep understanding and appreciation for the constant and rapid shift in how and where people consume content and share their experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A belief that organizations and industries are best when they are diverse and inclusive, and a commitment to ensuring that everything we do reflects that belief.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works well independently and remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preference for US-based candidates. European candidates will also be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By applying for this position, you are agreeing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timescale.com/legal/timescale-applicant-privacy-notice&quot;&gt;Timescale&#39;s Applicant Privacy Notice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We’re a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country. This is the dream that drove Wences Casares, our Founder and Chairman, to quietly transform the world of banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Although we are headquartered in Gibraltar, this is a full time, 100% remote position&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a Senior Front-End Web Developer who is motivated to combine the art of design with the art of programming. Responsibilities will include translating design wireframes to actual code that will produce visual elements of the application.&amp;nbsp;You will work with the product designer and bridge the gap between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides and defining how the application looks and works. Aside from publicly faced applications, the person will contribute to internal back office UIs, building easy-to-use interfaces for internal teams in ever-evolving architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop new user-facing features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build reusable code and libraries for future use&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Optimize application for maximum speed and scalability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure consistency of data gathered from the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with other team members and stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing internal tooling UI and platform for non-web-native team members to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great understanding of the newest trends, best practices and standards&amp;nbsp; in web development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in leading the development of medium to large-scale projects, focusing on UX and Security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of server-side CSS pre-processing platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient understanding of client-side scripting, security best practices, and browser performance optimizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great knowledge of advanced JavaScript libraries and frameworks, such as AngularJS, ReactJS, Vue (at least one of them), etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good understanding of asynchronous request handling, partial page updates, SPA, SSG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good knowledge of tools necessary for autonomous delivers (image processing, building, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with tools such as Figma and Lokalise is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient understanding of cross-browser compatibility issues and ways to work around them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient understanding of code versioning tools, such as GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good knowledge of SEO principles and ensuring that applications will adhere to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in designing web architecture, including Backend for Frontend, micro frontends, and usage of docker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent attention to detail with a high level of ownership mentality to deliver results independently and iteratively.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Xapo, we prioritize consumer protection and adhere to regulatory requirements by ensuring that all Xapiens are accountable for upholding principles of fair treatment, transparency, and ethical conduct in their interactions with customers and stakeholders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
