</div><div><strong>You will be responsible for</strong></div><ul>

</ul><div><strong>A typical workweek (example)</strong></div><ul>
<li>Every Monday, we have a one-on-one Zoom meeting to discuss our goals, whether you are meeting your goals, what went well, what did not go well, and so on.</li>
<li>You have one or multiple projects to complete. You can work on them whenever and however you want without being micromanaged. However, you must be able to meet the deadline and be accountable for the quality of the end solution.<ul><li>You’re also responsible for maintaining the Github repository of the project you’re working on, committing/pushing/documenting your changes, commenting on your code, and writing SOPs or technical documentation (if necessary). It doesn’t have to be pages long and can be very short and concise. But, as a developer, it makes life so much easier if you can return to your code in the future without having to think too hard about what you did. This is also about being considerate of your teammates' time.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>There must be some overlap in our working hours so you can respond to urgent requests (if any) or chat with your manager or any of our departments on demand if they have an IT question. This means that some extra tasks may arise during the week.<ul>
<li>You might have a day where one of our team members needs something urgent and needs it done the same or the next day, which can be valuable to the company, or a major issue needs to be fixed ASAP, in which case you might have to drop what you're working on and work on that or troubleshoot the entire day. If your main project's deadline cannot be met because of this (which is understandable), you should be able to communicate this on time.</li>
<li>However, most of the time you are able to work on your main projects in solitary. We understand that developers need complete focus. You can also chat and ask questions in our Slack channels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You might get stuck in programming and need help, or some development processes may need to be explained. If it cannot be explained/resolved via chat or video, screen-sharing calls can be scheduled throughout the week.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>The team (and our work culture)</strong></div><div>You’ll get to be part of a 100% remote company consisting of a diverse group of 95 talented individuals from all over the world. The people you will find on the team are veterinarians, marketers, content writers, editors, social media managers, graphics designers, content managers, and a lot more.<br><br>
</div><div>And you’ll get to join us on our united mission of improving the lives of pets and those who care for them. We dream big, and our vision is to become the biggest, most helpful pet company in the world.</div><div>
<br>You’ll get to be part of a company that’s undergoing hyper-growth, and the fast-paced work environment that comes with it. </div><div>
<br>And we’ve managed to grow at a healthy pace without ever sacrificing our culture and values.<br><br>
</div><div>Our company culture is focused on work and collaboration, but also while being open to the casual humor and chatter that makes us get to know each other.<br><br>
</div><div>We work hard, and you may have to work on the weekend every now and then if you have a lot on your plate. However, we have a huge understanding of the importance of time off, and we encourage each other to take time off.<br><br>
</div><div>A lot of us love traveling, and therefore, we plan on doing yearly company retreats, where we all meet up together and have fun.</div><div>

<div>Groove is looking for a very senior full-stack developer to help us accelerate our pursuit of building the best damn customer support tools on the planet. <br><br>You may have heard of us from our <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/top-posts">Journey to 500K blog</a> or from seeing us in places like NY Times, BBC, Forbes, Entrepreneur, Hacker News or elsewhere around the web. <br><br>This gig is not for the unseasoned. We need someone who's been in the trenches and helped grow a B2B SaaS company. A coder and a leader, who can hack with the best of them, and has an appreciation for good design and usability. A craftsman with the fire to help us execute on our product roadmap and move us along on our journey to 10MM in ARR. We've got a tight, scrappy team of former CTOs and founders working to make our app simpler, stronger and better. <br><br>We've put the time into talking with our customers and hitting product/market fit, and and need your help to step on the gas.<br><strong><br>From the technical side, here's what you'll need to know:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Ruby (with and without Rails)  </li>
<li>Expert knowledge of Javascript </li>
<li>In-depth knowledge of React, Redux and GraphQL</li>
<li>Deep understanding of HTML and CSS</li>
<li>Proficient understanding of git</li>
<li>Location: US or EU</li>
</ul><div>Experience working remotely is the only other requirement. You’ll be joining a completely remote team that knows how hackers work best. Meetings are kept to a minimum and everyone is left to get things done. Familiarity with Slack is a plus, and advanced-level Giphy skills will take you far.<br><br>If you’ve helped a fast-moving team win before and are ready to do it again, we want you on board. Our work impacts thousands of businesses around the globe, and we have our sights (very publicly) set on massive growth goals. If you think you can help us get there and are ready to join the family, email us at wewantyou@groovehq.com.<br><br>

<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul>
