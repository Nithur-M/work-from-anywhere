<div>We are Harley Therapy - established in 2006, and well-known as London's premium mental therapy providers. We have a team of highly experienced psychotherapists, clinical and counselling psychologists and psychiatrists in central London. We also run the Harley Therapy Platform, which is the UK’s leading mental therapy platform with therapists practising from their own rooms UK-wide.</div><div><br></div><div>We are a small team with big ambitions, and we are looking for a mid-level developer with equally strong skills in Ruby and JavaScript, and multi-year experience with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and CSS.</div><div><br></div><div>We use islands of JS and React, but experience with React is not necessary, as a good developer with good JS skills will be able to pick it up quickly. We like to use the right tool for the job, and only reach for React when the UI and UX will benefit.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a full time position, working remotely (GMT~5) to help improve all our software and websites, and in one case, help us rebuild the administrative system that helps our amazing admin team to manage clients and therapists.</div><div><br></div><div>You will have a hand in everything, and as we are a very small team, and you will also have a say in everything related to the technology side of the company. This also means that you will be expected to take responsibility for the entire stack from server to client. It will be common for you to be asked to build a new feature, right the way through from spec, UI, server, client, and of course deployment (we host on Heroku, with PostgreSQL, Sidekiq).</div><div><br></div><div>You will be an eager and passionate developer that loves what you do, and a fast learner that can hit the ground running without needing much of a hand to hold. A love of open source software would be a great benefit to you - and us.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a full time position, with great pay, and we will be happy to have you on board on a contract or employment basis.</div><div><br></div>

We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>

<ul style="">
<li style=""><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li style=""><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
