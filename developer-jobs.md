<li>
<strong>Great company culture.</strong> You’re going to be part of a team, not a cog in a machine.</li>
<li>
<strong>We’re here to enable you.</strong> It’s your work and your career. Our management team is here to help you become who you want to be, not to micromanage you.</li>
<li>
<strong>We value your ideas</strong>. At Vidalytics, our doors are always open. Need help? Come on in. Have a vision for the future of the company? We’d love to hear it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rest and relaxation</strong>. Employees enjoy a generous PTO package.</li>
<li>
<strong>Professional development</strong>. Want to continue your education? Vidalytics pays for classes, conferences, and more.</li>
<li>
<strong>You’re more than an employee</strong>, you’re a person. Every co-worker you’ll meet is committed to treating you with respect and kindness. You won’t hear stuff like, “It’s just business.”</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Vidalytics’ Values</strong></div><div><strong>(Yes, We’re Actually Serious About These) 😇</strong></div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>1 -</strong> <strong>Meritocracy</strong> – we’re building a Meritocracy, where the best ideas win -- not based on who has the bigger title. The following values underpin this. You should embody these traits.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>2 -</strong> <strong>Direct &amp; honest communication (transparency)</strong> – to be successful we have to face the truth and be honest. And that starts with each other. That means we give direct feedback. We want it in exchange. So feel free to argue your points, just be ready to get on board with decisions once they are made.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>3 -</strong> <strong>Ownership &amp; Accountability</strong> – the best people are the ones who OWN their position, tasks and even things that go beyond their ‘day-to-day responsibilities’. They never say, “that’s not my job.” Instead, they proactively spot problems and always try to think like the owner of the business.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>4 - Intelligence and smarts</strong> – we prize smart people. Who doesn’t? But it's not just book smarts but “business smarts” where you’re able to solve problems. Think for yourself. And don't be intimidated by any problem, no matter how complex. (Aka growth mindset).</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>5 - Self-aware (personal growth)</strong> – we want people who can look at themselves objectively, admit their mistakes and be open to growth. When you bring this attitude to your profession, it becomes a place of personal development and self-actualization.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>6 - Integrity</strong> – trust is the glue that holds us together. We need to be able to trust you whether it is regarding the quality of your hours, the deadlines you set for yourself or anything else.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>7- Urgency </strong>– we’re a startup and you need to be able to meet deadlines. We need someone who pushes themselves when they need to and hits deadlines. And also knows how to prioritize the important things.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>8 - Hardworking</strong> – we’re trying to get shit done on a budget. If you’re looking for an easy job, go elsewhere. Instead, this job will constantly have challenges and opportunities to learn and grow professionally. But we try to have fun while we’re doing it and consider each other friends.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>9 - Data</strong> – whenever possible, we want to make decisions based on data, not emotions or opinions.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>10 - No assholes</strong> – Doesn’t matter how good someone is at their job, if they are going to make life suck for other people on the team, then they aren’t welcomed at Vidalytics.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>To Apply:</strong></div><div>Please fill out your information here. It will come straight to us and we will be in touch right away! :)</div><div><br></div><div>Cheers,</div><div>👨🏻‍🦲</div><div>Patrick Stiles</div><div>Founder / CEO @ Vidalytics</div>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>

</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </span></p>

The architecture is a multi-page application — an MVC-based, <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">modular monolith using Laravel</strong> as a back-end framework. It was started back in 2013, and since then we’ve relentlessly increased code quality, features and test coverage, and are proud to say that we have almost zero legacy code or technical debt. We believe a modular monolithic architecture can reach a <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">level of perfection</strong> where it’s <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">superior to a micro-service architecture</strong> — despite an ever-increasing number of features.</p>
