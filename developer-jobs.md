                <p style="min-height:1.5em">This isn’t one of those situations where we tack “engineer” onto the back of every role at LiveKit. No. We’re actually looking for an <em>engineer</em>*. A rare type of engineer that cares about talking to and advocating for customers, helping unblock them by fixing bugs or writing up sample code, and providing customers with guidance, pointers and support. We say <em>rare</em> because in our experience, most engineers aspire to architect large-scale systems or tackle deeply technical problems. Said differently, most engineers want to have influence over the <em>technology</em> they work on or with. There’s nothing wrong with that, we love hardcore engineers. There are many at LiveKit — we’re not complaining. But, this time, we’re looking for a new teammate that wants to have influence over our <em>product</em> and <em>business</em>. If you’d be energized by seeing a developer or team flip a LiveKit integration from staging to production—secretly satisfied in knowing you helped make it possible—you are perfect for this.</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">For clarity, this role is compensated like any other engineering role.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2>As a Developer Success Engineer at LiveKit, you will:</h2><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Support and work directly with developers, teams, and companies building with LiveKit, both commercially and in the community.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Triage, file, and fix bugs, respond to support tickets, write sample and production-quality code, update documentation and author technical guides in service of customers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Collaborate and support community efforts specifically pertaining to technical issues.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Regularly meet or follow-up with LiveKit customers to ensure their continued success on the platform.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Collaborate closely with Sales and Partnerships teams on strategy and support them in customer conversations.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p></li></ul><h2>You'll thrive as an Developer Success Engineer if:</h2><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are an engineer.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You don’t mind reading more code than you write.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’re a natural teacher.</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You find joy in helping others learn and succeed.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You can break down complex concepts in a way that’s easily understood by others.</p></li></ul></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have excellent spoken and written English.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You enjoy learning new programming languages (quickly) and prototyping.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You enjoy building a community of people as passionate as you about our product.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p></li></ul><h2><strong>Bonus Points</strong></h2><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’ve literally done this before.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have experience working with a community of developers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have contributions to OSS.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’ve built something with LiveKit.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">In those school group projects, you did most of the work (:sigh:).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’re multilingual — LiveKit has users around the world.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p></li></ul><h2>Our Commitments to You</h2><h2>We offer</h2><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">A competitive salary and equity package.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Health, dental, and vision benefits</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Flexible vacations</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Remote work environment with necessary equipment provided.</p></li></ul><h2>Ready to Apply?</h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">If you're excited about driving the future of AI-native communications and want to make a significant impact at a high-growth company, we'd love to hear from you.</p>
