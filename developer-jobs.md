<div>AppSignal is seeking a new product developer. You'll be joining a small team of developers and designers working to enhance AppSignal and make it an even better product.</div><div>
<br>Our product assists thousands of developers in monitoring their web applications from A to Z. Our product alerts developers if something goes wrong and provides debugging insights to get to the root of issues.</div><div>
<br>AppSignal's features cover errors, performance, uptime, metrics, logging, and more. We support various programming languages (Ruby, Node.js, JavaScript, Elixir, Python, Go).<br><br>
</div><div>We're self-funded, profitable, 100% remote, and strive to be nice to our coworkers and customers. Read our hiring FAQ for more information on how our business operates.</div><h1>The role</h1><div>The product team continuously (re)developing monitoring features, improving existing features, enhancing the design and consistency, and ensuring our product operates seamlessly for users.</div><div>
<br>You'll be part of the team working on the AppSignal product. You'll write React, build pages and components, and touch some CSS (we have a design system built on TailwindCSS).</div><div>
<br>We deliver quickly, working closely with the design, business, and development teams. It's important to note that our codebase has a considerable surface area; this isn't a new product. The development challenges are interesting, and we're open to fresh patterns and ideas to enhance our application's structure.</div><h1>The Tech Stack</h1><ul>
<li>Our product was initially built with <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> (knowing Rails is a plus, but not required)</li>
<li>
<strong>React</strong> has gradually taken its place and now covers most of our app.</li>
<li>We use a <strong>GraphQL API</strong>
</li>
<li>We store data in <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>ClickHouse</strong>.</li>
<li>We've created a design system using <strong>TailwindCSS</strong>
</li>
<li>We employ headless React components (RadixUI, Tanstack) to create reusable components.</li>
</ul><div>
<br>The rest of AppSignal employs various other technologies to handle the 200 billion+ requests our customers monitor monthly.</div><div><br></div><h1>Our workflow and tools</h1><div>AppSignal operates in 8-week cycles. The product team typically dedicates 6 weeks to one or two projects and reserves 2 weeks as a cooldown period for bug fixes, small issues, and preparing for the next cycle.</div><div>
<br>Company-wise, we use these tools for communication and project management:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Basecamp</strong> for asynchronous communication within the company</li>
<li>
<strong>Github</strong> (Projects) to manage our code and technical projects</li>
<li>
<strong>Slack</strong> for direct messages or small group chats</li>
<li>
<strong>Airtable</strong> to keep track of information</li>
</ul><div>We hold a company-wide call once a week, followed by your team call, and other project-related calls are kept to a minimum.</div><h1>What We Offer</h1><ul>
<li>Salary is dependent on experience and the hiring approach (more details in our <a href="https://www.appsignal.com/jobs/faq/">FAQ about remote hiring</a>
</li>
<li>An annual personal budget of €1,200 for additional gear, conferences, and learning</li>
<li>A loaned MacBook for doing work</li>
<li>Remote work from anywhere as long as you align with our timezone (CEST)</li>
<li>A monthly budget for renting an office/workspace nearby</li>
<li>Unlimited vacation policy (on average, employees take 35 days a year)</li>
<li>No micromanagement. You're an adult. Feel free to wrap up early if your mind is tired. Hit the gym when you desire. Take care of errands, or go for a walk.</li>
<li>A team of friendly individuals to call your colleagues</li>
<li>We're open to a part-time (4 day) work-week</li>
</ul><h1>The Application Process</h1><ul>
<li>
<strong>Round 1</strong> consists of a brief interview to get acquainted and a short assignment to evaluate your programming skills. You'll receive compensation for time spent on this assignment (gift card or cash).</li>
<li>
<strong>Round 2</strong> involves an interview with your future coworkers from the product team.</li>
<li>
<strong>Round 3</strong> is a more in-depth interview. By this stage, we're enthusiastic about you and want to provide extensive context about the role.</li>
<li>
<strong>Round 4</strong> entails a culture check with the team, in addition to finalizing the hiring details</li>
</ul><h1>Managing Expectations</h1><div>Our hiring process is designed to be stress-free. We won't subject you to pressure or tricky questions. Let us know if you have anything we can consider (neurodiversity, accessibility, etc.).</div><div>
<br>We'll communicate our thoughts on your prospects and salary range as soon as possible. We'll inform you if you're in a hiring round with 10 other candidates or just 2. We'll send a preliminary offer letter once we can gauge your seniority level. We hope for transparency from you as well.<br><br>
</div><h1>Not sure if you should apply?</h1><div>If you're unsure about having enough experience for this role, please apply! We'd be disappointed to overlook a great candidate because you doubt your abilities. We're always happy to provide you feedback on your application and skill level.</div><h1>Looking Forward to Meeting You!</h1><div>Our team is excited about the opportunity to meet you. Feel free to ask us any questions (<a href="mailto:wes@appsignal.com">wes@appsignal.com</a>); we hope to see your application soon!<br><br>
</div><div>You may also reach out to one of our counselors if you feel more comfortable with that. Your questions will stay confidential, not be shared internally, and will certainly not influence your hiring chances. You can reach Jeff (he/him) via <a href="mailto:jeff@appsignal.com">jeff@appsignal.com</a> or Jelte (they/them) via <a href="mailto:jelte@appsignal.com">jelte@appsignal.com</a>.</div>

</p>

<div>
<a href="https://build.a.team/wwrfastrackreferral">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. <br><br>After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.<br><br>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>How to apply:<br></strong>Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/wwrfastrackreferral">https://build.a.team/wwrfastrackreferral</a> + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><strong><br>What you’ll do:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.</li>
<li>Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </li>
<li>You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.</li>
<li>Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.</li>
<li>The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>People looking for small gigs.</li>
<li>Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.</li>
<li>Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Our long-term vision:<br></strong><a href="https://build.a.team/wwrfastrackreferral">A·Team</a> is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. </div><div>
<br>To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.</div>

<p><strong>More about us</strong></p>
<p>We are a Swiss company that operates fully remotely.</p>

You will also have the chance to see a codebase that survived ~10 years and lead to having a profitable and growing business.</p>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="">
<li style=""><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li style=""><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>How to apply:</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">https://build.a.team/remotivereferral</a> + mention Remotive. </span>No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>What you’ll do:</strong></span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="">
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </span></p>
