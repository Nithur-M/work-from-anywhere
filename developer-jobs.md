<div>You LOVE programming. Been doing it for a long time. Can’t help build projects in your spare time. <br> <br>You LOVE Ruby on Rails. Yeah, it’s not the most popular thing out there, but it fits your brain like a hand in a glove. Custom DSLs, ultra-flexible, great library. It just makes you happy. <br> <br>And Javascript. React, React Native, Svelte, Stimulus, and of course plain vanilla JS. So cool what you can do &amp; how elegantly these days. <br> <br>Speaking of, you LOVE simplicity. Elegantly simple is your middle name. you’re not satisfied until it has that <em>feel</em>, that <em>smell</em> of elegant simplicity. You’re not afraid to push back on requirements &amp; be creative in coming up with a better, simpler way.<br><br>
</div><div>You’re confident in yourself &amp; your abilities. You know what great looks like &amp; you’re not easily satisfied with your own work.</div><div>
<br>What you DON’T love is red tape, politics, and dumb, complicated solutions just because no one had the courage to do better and stand up for their convictions. <br> <br>If this is you, apply immediately! <br><br>
</div><h1>What’s in it for you </h1><ul>
<li>You’ll be able to point to exactly what you created, both features and open-source projects that we release. </li>
<li>With just 4 engineers we created what other companies take armies to make, and we'll teach you how to work this effectively. </li>
<li>You get to see how great it feels when you grant someone's wish that might take you 4 minutes, but totally makes their day! </li>
<li>You’ll be part of a supportive team that has each other’s backs and doesn’t indulge in drama. We want to see everyone succeed because we want to see our customers taken care of. <br><br>
</li>
</ul><h1>Benefits </h1><ul>
<li>4 weeks of paid vacation per year, increasing to 5 after three years. Plus 10 holidays and 10 sick/wellness days. </li>
<li>Wellness stipend to help pay for your gym. Exercise makes you smarter. </li>
<li>We'll pay for a laptop or other gear you need to be productive (up to $1500). </li>
<li>We’ll pay for an audible membership. Books also make you smarter. <br><br>
</li>
</ul><h1>What sets Simplero apart </h1><ul>
<li>No VCs. No outside funding. No exit strategy. We do it because we love it today, and want to continue doing this in perpetuity, not because we hope to make out like bandits in the future. </li>
<li>We're profitable and have been in business for 13 years. It's a solid, stable, proven company, product, and model, not some fly-by-night operation or risky gamble. </li>
<li>We have 2,500+ active customers who have made almost $400M using Simplero. We’re the real deal. </li>
<li>We're founded by a developer (Calvin) who is still personally and passionately leading Product and Engineering, so you've got deep technical understanding and support right from the top. </li>
<li>We solve real problems for real people that they're happy to pay us real money to solve for them. We go home each day knowing we made a difference in someone's life. </li>
<li>We have a strong community around us, and cherish our close and mutually respectful relationships with our customers. It feels good knowing the people we’re serving. </li>
<li>We do things differently from other companies. You'll see. <br><br>

</div><div>We are a global team of 130+ awesome people working from over 40 countries around the globe.

<li>Conduct code reviews, identify and resolve technical issues, and maintain high coding standards</li>
<li>Collaborate with other development teams to identify and implement best practices in frontend development and related areas</li>
</ul><div><strong><br>About you/Requirements</strong></div><div>
<br>We would love to hear from you if you have significant experience in frontend development and can lead major development projects. You love working with data visualizations and believe React and web components are the future.</div><div>
<br>In particular, we are looking for:</div><ul>
<li>Extensive knowledge about JavaScript and React, and preferably Redux and a side effect managing library like Redux-Saga</li>
<li>Demonstrated experience leading large development projects, with good organization skills and the ability to plan well-structured projects, estimate tasks, manage stakeholders and coordinate with other cross-functional teams</li>
<li>A knack for data visualizations, with some familiarity of its principles and best practices</li>
<li>Knowledge about testing frameworks, like Jest</li>
<li>Excellent communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work in a remote team environment</li>
<li>Strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and ability to work independently</li>
</ul><div><strong><br>Some benefits</strong></div><ul>
<li>Freedom to choose when and how much you work - we only measure results</li>
<li>24 days of paid time off a year, plus your local holidays</li>
<li>In-person meetups for team-building (expenses covered)</li>
<li>4-6 weeks paid sabbatical (depending on the tenure)</li>
<li>Laptop budget up to €2,500 and it renews every 3 years</li>

<p>
  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> Fully remote company (worldwide, incorporated in Berlin)
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://opencraft.com/">https://opencraft.com/</a>
</p>

<div>Do you care about contributing to open-source, and appreciate a good challenge? We do too! :) <br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Open-source<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are a team of veteran open-source developers, working on educational and community-based projects in an<a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/open_first/"> open-first</a> environment – and we are looking for new members. By joining us, you will work full-time on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums. </div><div>
<br>We care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.</div><div>
<br><strong>Remote-first</strong>
</div><div>
<br>Unlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it’s none of our business when or where you work from. :)</div><div>
<br>We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!). We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good documentation practices.</div><div>
<br><strong>Online education<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are one of the main contributors to the <a href="https://open.edx.org/">Open edX project</a>, the main open-source MOOC platform created by MIT, Harvard and many other top universities. It powers sites like <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, the <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library">MIT Open Learning Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fun-mooc.fr/">national online learning platform for France</a>. We provide development and hosting for institutions like <a href="https://onlinelearning.hms.harvard.edu/hmx/">Harvard Medical School</a>, <a href="https://www.labxchange.org">Harvard LabXchange</a>, <a href="https://ondemand.cloudera.com">Cloudera</a>, <a href="https://www.upskill.autodesk.com">Autodesk</a>, and several governments. We are not affiliated with <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, but we contribute and work with them on various projects. </div><div>
<br><strong>Technical stack</strong><br><br>
</div><div>The Open edX project is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. Tasks are varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working full-stack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Contracting terms<br></strong><br>
</div><div>This is a full-time, permanent contract position. We aim for long-term relationships -- once in, almost all team members stay for many years. </div><div><br></div><div>We care about paying fairly: </div><ul>
<li>Team members set their own compensation level, which is paid based on hours worked (no unpaid overtime!). </li>
<li>When determining your rate, we will expect you to factor in benefits (vacation, healthcare, purchase budgets, etc.) - the idea is to let <em>you</em> pick the benefits that are useful to you, rather than offer one-size-fits-all packages that aren’t always very valuable.</li>
<li>We also proactively apply generous raises team-wide, based on the company results at the end of each year. <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/team_compensation/">See the details about how we approach compensation in our handbook</a>.</li>
</ul><div>We also firmly believe in work-life balance: as long as you deliver what you commit to, there is a lot of latitude in how much work you can choose to accept. We are open to time commitments anywhere in the 30h to 40h/week range, and highly discourage working more than that. It’s important to have time to ourselves, as well as having some slack, and there are diminishing returns in working more anyway. We are currently recruiting precisely to preserve that balance, and ensure we have plenty of capacity to handle our projects.</div><div><br></div><div>We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.</div><div>
<br><strong>Basic Requirements:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Experience with contributing to free software projects - small contributions are completely fine, but you <em>must</em> have at least one patch or pull request merged in a third-party project, or been a maintainer of an open source project with significant adoption. (Note that you can contribute now to satisfy this requirement - see for example the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/build-test-release-wg/projects/1">Open edX release issues</a>, fixing one of these issues guarantees an interview.)</li>
<li>Senior developer with 3+ years working with Python</li>
<li>Experience with Python web frameworks, specifically Django</li>
<li>3+ years of HTML, Javascript, and CSS (experience with React and/or Typescript is a big plus!)</li>
<li>Experience with unit testing</li>
<li>Comfortable working in a Linux environment, specifically Debian or Ubuntu</li>
<li>Experience with databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Additional Skills:</strong><br><br>
</div><div>You will work on tasks from the following categories, but you can pick up the skills on the job if you haven't mastered these yet:</div><ul>
<li>DevOps experience, especially on Debian/Ubuntu servers, Terraform, Vault, Packer, Prometheus, ELK, Docker. We are building a modern infrastructure and having a strong DevOps presence on top of core software engineering skills is a big plus with us.</li>
<li>Cloud computing, like AWS or OpenStack</li>
<li>Configuration management tools such as Ansible, Consul</li>
<li>RabbitMQ, Redis &amp; Elasticsearch</li>
<li>Mobile development (iOS and/or Android)</li>
<li>Managing clients &amp; projects from beginning to completion (senior developer)</li>
<li>Public speaking at conferences (you would present a talk every year at the Open edX Con)</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Apply for this Position</strong><br><br>
</div><div>Our recruitment process differs from most other companies - we don’t believe resumes and the traditional interviews to be particularly effective. Often, they tell more about how good someone is at interviewing, rather than at the actual work. So, our initial interview is lighter and easier to pass than in other companies - but we then provide you with real (and paid!) work to see how it works out in reality.</div><ul>
<li>Step 1: You apply by filling out this form: <a href="https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/">https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/</a> </li>
<li>Step 2: We do two interviews with candidates matching the requirements listed above. The first interview includes a (simple) coding exercise.</li>
<li>Step 3: If this works out, we hire you! We start with a 2 months <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/processes/#recruitment">trial period</a>, which allows both you and the rest of the team to fully evaluate how we work together, and is followed by a final review and confirmation. </li>
</ul>
