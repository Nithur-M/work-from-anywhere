                <p>We’re recruiting a full-stack developer to join our product team at Spidergap/AirManual.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a rare opportunity to join a small, 100% remote, profitable and ambitious company that also appreciates that there’s more to work than revenue (!).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At Spidergap/AirManual, we’re:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">Fueled by the passion and exceptional talent of a successful start-up</li>
<li style="">Hungry to amaze our customers and grow the business</li>
<li style="">Always looking to grow as individuals and a team</li>
<li style="">AND Focused on doing it all without unnecessary stress, and with a healthy work-life balance</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If you’re a software developer who moves quickly and values code quality, wants to grow by working in a small and experienced team, and loves helping real customers to achieve their goals… then read on!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What we do</p>
<p>We’re a SaaS business with two products: Spidergap and AirManual. You’ll be working primarily on Spidergap, with opportunities to contribute to both products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Spidergap</p>
<p>With Spidergap, our goal is to make it easy for organizations to support the personal development of their employees. We do this by providing a platform for employees to get feedback, plan personal development, and take action.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’ve been the <a href="https://www.capterra.com/360-degree-feedback-software/" rel="nofollow">top-rated 360° Feedback tool since 2017</a>, and are used in 134+ countries by thousands of organizations including Samsung, 3M, Sony, the NHS, the European Commission, Breville, Konica Minolta and Philips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’ve recently kicked off an ambitious plan to expand our product offering, as we look to support employees with all aspects of personal development. This includes a revamp of our product working in the latest technologies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>AirManual</p>
<p>We created AirManual in 2020 with the goal of helping other businesses to scale up, without constant stress. We provide tools for documenting and automating processes, working together in teams, and reviewing the health of the entire business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re now supporting over 100 businesses, including big names such as Asahi Beer and with particular traction in the Accountancy market. As with Spidergap, we consistently get <a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/235723/AirManual/" rel="nofollow">exceptionally positive reviews</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re currently expanding the AirManual product to support teams with wider challenges that cause stress in small businesses, such as managing the day-to-day issues that occur in teams.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>Requirements</strong><br><br></p>
<p>We’re looking for something who’s a great fit for our company values, and who can bring the technical talent needed in this specific role.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Do you share our values?</p>
<p>We're looking for people who share our values:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="">
<li style=""><strong>Focus on impact: </strong>We know our growth is dependent on increasing the value we deliver to customers. We focus our energy on improvements that will make a real difference, with a desired outcome made clear up-front. We expect everyone to understand <em>why</em> they are working on a particular activity or objective, being clear on how it will benefit the business and our customers.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Be proactive and dependable: </strong>Everyone can solve problems and remove barriers to growth — both personally and for the company. We are quick to raise issues and ideas, and to recommend next steps. We make it easier for others to feel they can depend on us by being proactive in our communication and action.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Pay attention to detail: </strong>We believe the quality of everything we do is a competitive advantage. We expect high attention-to-detail, whether it's in how we write an email, review our analytics, or design the site. We delight in getting the details right, even in internal documents. High attention to detail isn’t something you turn on and off — it’s an attitude. </li>
<li style=""><strong>Always look to improve:</strong> We survive and grow by constantly looking for opportunities to improve our solutions, our processes and ourselves. We own our mistakes, using them as an opportunity to learn what changes we should make to processes and tools. We expect our people to proactively look for opportunities to develop and improve our own performance.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Enjoy the journey: </strong>We consider our health and families to be more important than work. We ensure no-one feels that they are frequently required to work excessive hours. We support each other in overcoming problems and achieving work and life goals. We’re positive and enthusiastic — helping everyone feel energized to take us to the next level. We don’t pin our happiness on the attainment of a particular end goal — we delight in each step along the way.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>We don’t just ‘say’ these are our values. We use them all the time — to recruit the right people, manage individual performance, recognize good practice, and make decisions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Is the role right for you?</p>
<p>A large part of the work will be developing and supporting new functionality using TypeScript/NodeJS/React.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We follow “clean" code principles, agile processes and continuous integration tools to efficiently take features from concept to roll-out, and to continuously optimize our processes. Your attention to detail will help us to amaze our customers, and to grow our services and codebase in a robust and maintainable way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">Collaborate to deliver solutions from design to release</li>
<li style="">Write reliable, modular, well-tested and “clean” code</li>
<li style="">Proactively raise ideas and issues, contributing to designs with feedback and suggestions for improvement</li>
<li style="">Support other team members through peer review</li>
<li style="">Help to optimize our development processes and build tools</li>
<li style="">Ensure progress, issues and ideas are communicated clearly to the right people</li>
<li style="">Help us to deliver outstanding customer support.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tech stack (Spidergap):</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">TypeScript</li>
<li style="">Node.js (NestJS)</li>
<li style="">Remix (React)</li>
<li style="">MySQL</li>
<li style="">Google Cloud</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>AirManual uses a similar tech stack, using PostgresSQL rather than MySQL and currently reviewing whether to adopt Remix + TypeScript.</p>
<p>You may be occasionally asked asked to support legacy solutions developed with Express, Create React App, AngularJS, Loopback, and PHP.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">GitHub</li>
<li style="">Slack</li>
<li style="">Codeship</li>
<li style="">Dropbox Paper</li>
<li style="">GMail</li>
<li style="">Hubspot</li>
<li style="">Sentry</li>
<li style="">(And many more!)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">Passionate and driven — about software development, and about life outside work</li>
<li style="">Excellent attention to detail, including a focus on delivering high-quality code that is easy to maintain and scale</li>
<li style="">2+ years of JavaScript experience, working on production code</li>
<li style="">Experience with front-end libraries in production such as React or Vue</li>
<li style="">Experience with React, SQL, HTML, CSS and automated testing</li>
<li style="">Happy to work remotely</li>
<li style="">Loves 'going the extra mile' to deliver outstanding work</li>
<li style="">Believes in and practices self-improvement / personal development</li>
<li style="">Keen and able to learn</li>
<li style="">Loves technology and figuring out how things work and helping others to do the same</li>
<li style="">Communicates clearly, in a friendly way</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">This is a 100% remote job — you are responsible for having an effective work environment</li>
<li style="">You must be a location that overlaps the working hours of our existing team members — we will only accept applications in timezones from UTC -4 (New York) to UTC +6 (Dhaka)</li>
<li style="">Due to local employment and/or international laws, we cannot currently employ people based in Brazil, France, or UAE.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br><strong>Benefits</strong><br><br></p>
<p>We strive to make Spidergap <em>the</em> best place to work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are doing this by creating the best products in our markets, building a great diverse team, encouraging great work-life balance (including taking lots of annual leave), being family-friendly, having fun, and maintaining a strong culture of continuous improvement (business and personally).</p>

But, as a developer, it makes life so much easier if you can return to your code in the future without having to think too hard about what you did. This is also about being considerate of your teammates' time.</p>

      <p>As the publisher of Ubuntu we serve millions of developers, building for the cloud, IoT and data science. We aim to make open source easier and more reliable for innovators and enterprises.</p>
<p>We have created a new Developer Relations team to engage directly with open source communities and developer-centric organisations. We hope both to communicate our vision and products for better open source development experiences, and also to have a better feedback loop from those audiences to shape our offerings and priorities.</p>
<p>A Developer Relations Engineer is a technical expert, strategist and communicator with deep empathy for developers. This discipline combines practical engineering skills with firm diplomacy across organisational boundaries, in both directions. Like our audience, a Developer Relations Engineer is never satisfied with the status quo, and is driven by an insatiable curiosity to find better ways to get things done. They are problem-solvers and inventors, who understand people's needs and love the way that tools can be adapted to meet them. They stay current with tech trends and provide insights and guidance while fostering innovation.</p>
