<h2>About Fluence Labs</h2>

<p>At Fluence Labs, we are working on new decentralized network protocols to make the internet more open and secure. We believe that open source and open protocols enable better technology for the future of humanity.</p>

<p>Fluence Labs is a distributed team of engineers residing in New York, Moscow, Amsterdam, Helsinki, and Krasnodar. Our culture is remote-first, self-managed, and we value transparent decision making and an open source ethos.</p>

<p>Our primary project is Fluence, an open application platform, where apps can build on each other, share data and users. Fluence is powered by a decentralized computing protocol that enables applications to evolve quickly with composability and monetize by licensing even low-level components. Fluence serves as an open runtime for internet applications; the new alternative to proprietary platforms, and APIs.</p>

<p>We are looking for new great additions to the Fluence Labs core team. We would like to speak to people who are interested in decentralized technology, empathetic, humble, passionate about their work, and strive for excellence. We expect that candidates are experts in their field, keep up to date with recent developments, and are excellent communicators, both in oral and written form.</p><br/><br/>Please mention the word **SATISFACTORILY** and tag RMzUuMTc1LjExMy44 when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMzUuMTc1LjExMy44).

</ul><h1>You’ll be a great fit for the team if you:</h1><ul>
<li>Enjoy a team-oriented and collaborative work space (we make each other's work better)</li>
<li>Have flexibility and a growth mindset: we’re all continuous learners here––our sprint retrospectives are the best</li>
<li>Feel a rush when your code ships</li>
<li>Thrive in a small team with open, positive communication</li>
<li>Love the autonomy of working on your own schedule––we trust that you’ll meet your deadlines and leave you to it</li>

</div><ul>
<li>Use your technical expertise to solve interesting problems and create unique, innovative tools.</li>
<li>Be part of an honest, kind work environment with a supportive team</li>

<p> </p>
<p>Our desire is for eye-tracking to recognize when a participant no longer has eye contact on the experience, pause, &amp; take further action. <span style="color: var(--remotive-chocolate);">An example:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="">
<li style=""><span style="color: var(--remotive-chocolate);">The video pauses &amp; says "You are worth waiting for, resume when you can," with 30 seconds to 1-minute countdown on screen before the experience restarts</span></li>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul>
