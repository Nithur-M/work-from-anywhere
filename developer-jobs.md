                &lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who we are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating developers &lt;/strong&gt;with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                <h1>About Clerk</h1><p style="min-height:1.5em">We build developer tools for authentication. We're known for our React components like <code>&lt;SignIn/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;UserProfile /&gt;</code> that "just work" when they're added to the page.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Our components are powered by a new type of API: a frontend-facing API that relies on session tokens for authorization, instead of a backend-facing API that relies on a secret key. We've found this pattern unlocks a new level of efficiency. Developers can implement Clerk faster than traditional APIs because it comes built-in with UX and UI. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">To learn more about the approach, see our talk on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4">A Component is Worth a Thousand APIs</a>.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h1>About the Role</h1><p style="min-height:1.5em">We're seeking a Developer Success Engineer to join our team, working at the intersection of technical problem-solving and developer experience.

We are looking for someone who can let them know what is possible with the platform. We seek to make developers 100x more effective, and build 100x more impactful systems.

                <h2>LiveKit Developer Success Engineering</h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">This isn’t one of those situations where we tack “engineer” onto the back of every role at LiveKit. No. We’re actually looking for an <em>engineer</em>*. A rare type of engineer that cares about talking to and advocating for customers, helping unblock them by fixing bugs or writing up sample code, and providing customers with guidance, pointers and support. We say <em>rare</em> because in our experience, most engineers aspire to architect large-scale systems or tackle deeply technical problems. Said differently, most engineers want to have influence over the <em>technology</em> they work on or with. There’s nothing wrong with that, we love hardcore engineers. There are many at LiveKit — we’re not complaining. But, this time, we’re looking for a new teammate that wants to have influence over our <em>product</em> and <em>business</em>. If you’d be energized by seeing a developer or team flip a LiveKit integration from staging to production—secretly satisfied in knowing you helped make it possible—you are perfect for this.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><p style="min-height:1.5em">*For clarity, this role is compensated like any other engineering role.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h3>As an Developer Success Engineer at LiveKit, you will:</h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Support and work directly with developers, teams, and companies building with LiveKit, both commercially and in the community.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Triage, file, and fix bugs, respond to support tickets, write sample and production-quality code, update documentation and author technical guides in service of customers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Regularly meet or follow-up with LiveKit customers to ensure their continued success on the platform.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Collaborate closely with Sales and Partnerships teams on strategy and support them in customer conversations.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2>About You</h2><h3>You'll thrive as an Developer Success Engineer if you:</h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are an engineer.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You don’t mind reading more code than you write.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’re a natural teacher.</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You find joy in helping others learn and succeed.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You can break down complex concepts in a way that’s easily understood by others.</p></li></ul></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have excellent spoken and written English.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You enjoy learning new programming languages (quickly) and prototyping.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Bonus Points</strong></h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’ve literally done this before.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have experience working with a community of developers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have contributions to OSS.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’ve built something with LiveKit.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">In those school group projects, you did most of the work (:sigh:).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’re multilingual — LiveKit has users around the world.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2>Our Commitments to You</h2><h3>We offer:</h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">A competitive salary and equity package.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Health, dental, and vision benefits</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Flexible vacations</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Remote work environment with necessary equipment provided.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h3>Ready to Apply?</h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">If you're excited about driving the future of AI-native communications and want to make a significant impact at a high-growth company, we'd love to hear from you.</p>

&lt;p&gt;We are Orderly, the ultimate destination for decentralized trading platforms. We are not satisfied with the limitations of centralized exchanges or the complexities of building decentralized order books. We aim to make trading easy, fast, and secure for everyone. How? By fusing the simplicity of CeFi with the power of DeFi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of the issue lies “liquidity”. Builders often grapple with a paradox; traders need liquidity, but liquidity demands traders. Our solution is simple as is bold –&lt;span class=&quot;text-primary-100 font-semibold&quot;&gt;concentrate all liquidity into one order book. One order book that connects all the liquidity in the crypto space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our ambition doesn&#39;t stop there. We&#39;re omnichain, championing chain abstraction. We envision seamless transactions, where the underlying blockchain is merely a detail. By concentrating liquidity, we aim to redefine the crypto landscape, making bridging and wrapped assets a thing of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are Orderly, and we are here to revolutionize DeFi, democratizing access to financial opportunities and fostering a fair, equitable paradigm for all.&lt;/p&gt;

Collaborate with marketing and product teams to ensure that developer-facing content aligns with our overall messaging and product roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

                &lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with the best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are Orderly, the ultimate destination for decentralized trading platforms. We are not satisfied with the limitations of centralized exchanges or the complexities of building decentralized order books. We aim to make trading easy, fast, and secure for everyone. How? By fusing the simplicity of CeFi with the power of DeFi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of the issue lies “liquidity”. Builders often grapple with a paradox; traders need liquidity, but liquidity demands traders. Our solution is simple as is bold –&lt;span class=&quot;text-primary-100 font-semibold&quot;&gt;concentrate all liquidity into one order book. One order book that connects all the liquidity in the crypto space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our ambition doesn&#39;t stop there. We&#39;re omnichain, championing chain abstraction. We envision seamless transactions, where the underlying blockchain is merely a detail. By concentrating liquidity, we aim to redefine the crypto landscape, making bridging and wrapped assets a thing of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are Orderly, and we are here to revolutionize DeFi, democratizing access to financial opportunities and fostering a fair, equitable paradigm for all.&lt;/p&gt;
