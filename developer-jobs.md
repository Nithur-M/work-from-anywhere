<div>
<strong>Hello Ruby on Rails Developers!<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Here's the deal; before our clients hire us, they've often already invested a lot of time, energy, and money into having custom web applications developed to help them solve their business challenges. They come to us looking for a team to provide dependable support and maintenance of their existing Ruby on Rails projects. We do this in the form of recurring retainers where we take care of small feature updates, bug fixes, performance improvements, chipping away at their technical debt, and helping them experiment as they navigate forward as a business.<br><br>
</div><div>What we rarely do is spin up brand new web applications for them. We learned years ago that we perform better and are more successful developing long-term client relationships rather than working on one-off builds, so we stopped competing on those projects.<br><br>
</div><div>The tradeoff? We get to build lasting partnerships with our clients and have some influence on how they're planning for the life of their web applications.<br><br>
</div><div>So, if you're the type of developer that really enjoys shiny, new things (and/or pitching entire app rewrites), this probably isn't the position for you.<br><br>
</div><div>But if you're the type of developer that enjoys jumping into the deep end of complex projects, helping iterate and improve software, taking on responsibility, and being given opportunities to help lead projects, then we should talk.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Our Core Values<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<strong>🙋 PROACTIVE</strong> - We actively seek opportunities to improve our client’s products, our processes, and our abilities.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>🐒 CURIOUS</strong> - A natural curiosity for the undiscovered results in remarkable work for our clients and stronger connections for our team. We ask questions, learn, and aren't afraid to fail.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>🤝 DEPENDABLE</strong> - We are invested in our work. We manage expectations. We support our clients and teammates. We hold ourselves, our teammates, and our clients accountable.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>🕺 VERSATILE</strong> - We readily adapt to change and encourage innovation because our team and work are transparent and flexible.<br><br>
</div><div>🙃 <strong>DELIGHTFUL</strong> - We choose to set a mindful, positive tone that allows everyone to flourish.<br><br>

<h4><strong>About Dagabase</strong></h4><p>Dagabase is a decentralized Cloud data storage solution that keeps things simple.</p><p>And by simple, we mean: secure, stable, and cost-effective. By removing the complexity and drama from what should have always been guaranteed simplicity, we make room for magic. </p><p>Dagabase is comprised of a strong, ever-growing network of independent devices. The solution is decentralized, which means that you are not dependent on third-party controls or vulnerable to third-party outages. Decentralized data storage is not concentrated in the hands of only one player. It is, instead, a system of devices and nodes owned - and “rented out” - by enterprises or even individuals. While Dagabase provides the solution and the network, the availability of your data is guaranteed by multiple independent participants within the network, and control lies with you.</p><p>If you are energized by the chance to play a key role in tackling decentralization challenges and unlocking new opportunities for Dagabase, to help us help millions of organizations reclaim their data and own their cloud.</p><p><br><strong>About the position</strong></p><p>We are looking for a Lead Front-End Developer to help us shape the future of the cloud.</p><p>You will be part of a team focused on creating our main platform experience with web3 technologies. This position is perfect for someone enthusiastic about web3 products and who wants to work on initiatives with major impact and cutting-edge technologies.</p><p>We are looking for an exceptional developer to lead by example, participate in task-oriented development, roadmap planning, and prepare the necessary foundational work to ensure our platform is successful.</p><p>You will work in a senior team to ensure that changes proposed for our web application are suitable both for the customer and the long-term health of our product and Dagabase itself. In addition, you will monitor the impact of deployed changes to ensure we maintain the high standards we expect from ourselves and our product.</p><p><br><strong>About you</strong></p><p>You know and love everything about web* technologies (e.g., HTTP, WebSockets, Web RTC, DOM, CSS, and the browser as a platform) but have a breadth-first approach to software engineering/development, looking outside the browser platform when needed to learn what is required to do your best work. Ideally, you’ve recently been curious about web3 and have played with popular tools like ethers, wallet connect/metamask, and passionate about decentralization. In addition, you have at least 7+ years of experience doing front-end development with Vue.JS, TypeScript, and Node.js.</p><p>You enjoy building data-intensive applications and want to push the boundaries of what component-based declarative front-ends can do. If that sounds like you, we invite you on a journey mixed with challenges, fun, and gratification. As a result, you will deliver highly performant, delightful, and consistent user experiences across web and mobile platforms.</p><p><br><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul>
<li><p>Proficiency in TypeScript and Vue</p></li>
<li><p>Exposure to writing unit, integration, and E2E tests</p></li>
<li><p>Have a keen eye for UI details. Pixel perfection is a must</p></li>
<li><p>Experience in Figma</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding of Web RTC and progressive web apps</p></li>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
