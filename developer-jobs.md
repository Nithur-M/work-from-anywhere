<p>
  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> Fully remote company (worldwide, incorporated in Berlin)
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://opencraft.com/">https://opencraft.com/</a>
</p>

<div>Do you care about contributing to open-source, and appreciate a good challenge? We do too! :) <br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Open-source<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are a team of veteran open-source developers, working on educational and community-based projects in an<a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/open_first/"> open-first</a> environment – and we are looking for new members. By joining us, you will work full-time on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums. </div><div>
<br>We care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.</div><div>
<br><strong>Remote-first</strong>
</div><div>
<br>Unlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it’s none of our business when or where you work from. :)</div><div>
<br>We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!). We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good documentation practices.</div><div>
<br><strong>Online education<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are one of the main contributors to the <a href="https://open.edx.org/">Open edX project</a>, the main open-source MOOC platform created by MIT, Harvard and many other top universities. It powers sites like <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, the <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library">MIT Open Learning Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fun-mooc.fr/">national online learning platform for France</a>. We provide development and hosting for institutions like <a href="https://onlinelearning.hms.harvard.edu/hmx/">Harvard Medical School</a>, <a href="https://www.labxchange.org">Harvard LabXchange</a>, <a href="https://ondemand.cloudera.com">Cloudera</a>, <a href="https://www.upskill.autodesk.com">Autodesk</a>, and several governments. We are not affiliated with <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, but we contribute and work with them on various projects. </div><div>
<br><strong>Technical stack</strong><br><br>
</div><div>The Open edX project is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. Tasks are varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working full-stack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Contracting terms<br></strong><br>
</div><div>This is a full-time, permanent contract position. We aim for long-term relationships -- once in, almost all team members stay for many years. </div><div><br></div><div>We care about paying fairly: </div><ul>
<li>Team members set their own compensation level, which is paid based on hours worked (no unpaid overtime!). </li>
<li>When determining your rate, we will expect you to factor in benefits (vacation, healthcare, purchase budgets, etc.) - the idea is to let <em>you</em> pick the benefits that are useful to you, rather than offer one-size-fits-all packages that aren’t always very valuable.</li>
<li>We also proactively apply generous raises team-wide, based on the company results at the end of each year. <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/team_compensation/">See the details about how we approach compensation in our handbook</a>.</li>
</ul><div>We also firmly believe in work-life balance: as long as you deliver what you commit to, there is a lot of latitude in how much work you can choose to accept. We are open to time commitments anywhere in the 30h to 40h/week range, and highly discourage working more than that. It’s important to have time to ourselves, as well as having some slack, and there are diminishing returns in working more anyway. We are currently recruiting precisely to preserve that balance, and ensure we have plenty of capacity to handle our projects.</div><div><br></div><div>We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.</div><div>
<br><strong>Basic Requirements:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Experience with contributing to free software projects - small contributions are completely fine, but you <em>must</em> have at least one patch or pull request merged in a third-party project, or been a maintainer of an open source project with significant adoption. (Note that you can contribute now to satisfy this requirement - see for example the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/build-test-release-wg/projects/1">Open edX release issues</a>, fixing one of these issues guarantees an interview.)</li>
<li>Senior developer with 3+ years working with Python</li>
<li>Experience with Python web frameworks, specifically Django</li>
<li>3+ years of HTML, Javascript, and CSS (experience with React and/or Typescript is a big plus!)</li>
<li>Experience with unit testing</li>
<li>Comfortable working in a Linux environment, specifically Debian or Ubuntu</li>
<li>Experience with databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Additional Skills:</strong><br><br>
</div><div>You will work on tasks from the following categories, but you can pick up the skills on the job if you haven't mastered these yet:</div><ul>
<li>DevOps experience, especially on Debian/Ubuntu servers, Terraform, Vault, Packer, Prometheus, ELK, Docker. We are building a modern infrastructure and having a strong DevOps presence on top of core software engineering skills is a big plus with us.</li>
<li>Cloud computing, like AWS or OpenStack</li>
<li>Configuration management tools such as Ansible, Consul</li>
<li>RabbitMQ, Redis &amp; Elasticsearch</li>
<li>Mobile development (iOS and/or Android)</li>
<li>Managing clients &amp; projects from beginning to completion (senior developer)</li>
<li>Public speaking at conferences (you would present a talk every year at the Open edX Con)</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Apply for this Position</strong><br><br>
</div><div>Our recruitment process differs from most other companies - we don’t believe resumes and the traditional interviews to be particularly effective. Often, they tell more about how good someone is at interviewing, rather than at the actual work. So, our initial interview is lighter and easier to pass than in other companies - but we then provide you with real (and paid!) work to see how it works out in reality.</div><ul>
<li>Step 1: You apply by filling out this form: <a href="https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/">https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/</a> </li>
<li>Step 2: We do two interviews with candidates matching the requirements listed above. The first interview includes a (simple) coding exercise.</li>
<li>Step 3: If this works out, we hire you! We start with a 2 months <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/processes/#recruitment">trial period</a>, which allows both you and the rest of the team to fully evaluate how we work together, and is followed by a final review and confirmation. </li>
</ul>

    <p>We're looking for a Senior Front End Developer to join our team to help change the way developers build their applications.</p>
<p>You'll be primarily responsible for growing our NextJS apps to a comprehensive development stack, including our backend API, user authentication and expanding our React UI. You'll be an indispensable part of the team, by working very closely with our frontend team, designers, founders and backend engineers; you'll be directly contributing to technical choices, building a team culture and co-authoring internal processes for a growing team.</p>
<p>This role is specifically focused around observability (”o11y”). You will work to improve logging, reporting and analytics in the Dashboard for all of our tools.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to truly take ownership of a web platform, defining how it evolves, and how we can scale our users, team, product and processes.</p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>This role requires three critical attributes:</p>
<ol>
<li>You’ve got a background in working with data. In addition to your frontend skills, you’ve got experience with wrangling and visualizing data. You might have worked on other customer-facing dashboards, building time-series visualizations for reporting metrics like usage and utilization. You have meaningful experience presenting data to users. You don’t need to be a database expert, but you are solid SQL—optimizing SQL queries would be a common task, for example.<br><br></li>
<li>Ability to write great production <strong>React</strong> code in Next.JS. You know React and Next.JS very well. You know a state management tool like Redux or MobX really well. You implicitly know many of the reasons why we’re rewriting our Dashboard to use React Query instead of MobX. You can take a MobX store and rewrite it using React Query.<br><br></li>
<li>&nbsp;Ability to self-manage. Every company will expect you to self-manage to some degree, but Supabase takes this to a new level. We are a flat, early-stage startup without a lot of structure. To thrive in this environment, you’ll need to be a motivated self-starter who is good working asynchronously across multiple teams. We’re looking for someone who will identify things that need improvement and put their heads down until it’s shipped.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What you’ll do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build our logging, reporting and analytics tools in the Dashboard, iterating existing features and building new ones.</li>
<li>Take ownership of the Dashboard front end stack, planning and iterating on it based on a roadmap that you have an active voice in moulding.</li>
<li>Build tools within the Supabase ecosystem, occasionally dogfooding our own work</li>
<li>Interacting with customers on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Help build out the test suite for the Dashboard</li>
<li>Improve the speed, performance and code quality of our Dashboard</li>
<li>Triage and fix GitHub issues</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Must haves</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5+ years experience in web development (React, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, relational databases);</li>
<li>Knowledge of modern JS (ES6 etc), React UI Components (we use Radix), state management (Mobx, Redux, etc), and data fetching strategies using React Query / SWR, etc;</li>
<li>Experience with building visual tools for logging, reporting analytics;</li>
<li>Experience with relational databases (especially Postgres) and SQL</li>
<li>Willingness to evolve and shape the development tools/stack;</li>
<li>Willingness to regularly talk to customers to ensure we’re solving problems they have;</li>
<li>Willingness to work in a fast-paced environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nice to haves</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience with <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3js</a>;</li>
<li>Experience working on large projects, and the code and contribution complexities that come with it;</li>
<li>Web accessibility experience;</li>
<li>Experience working on a large, open-source project.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We offer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>100% remote work from anywhere in the world. No location-based adjustment to your salary.</li>
<li>ESOP (equity ownership in the company)</li>
<li>Autonomous work. We work collaboratively on projects, but you set your own pace.</li>
<li>Health, Vision and Dental benefits. Supabase covers 100% of the cost for employees and 80% for dependents</li>
<li>Generous Tech Allowance for any office setup you need</li>
<li>Annual Education Allowance</li>
<li>Annually run off-sites.</li>
</ul>

    

    <div class="content-conclusion"><h3>BUILD IN A WEEKEND. SCALE TO BILLIONS</h3>
<p>Supabase adds auth, realtime, and restful APIs to Postgres without a single line of code.</p>
<p>Each project within Supabase is an isolated&nbsp;Postgres cluster, allowing customers to scale independently, while still providing the features that you need to build: instant database setup, auth, row level security, realtime data streams, auto-generating APIs, and a simple to use web interface.</p>
<p>We are a fully remote company.</p>
<p>Key Tech: Javascript, Typescript, Go, Elixir, PostgREST (haskell), Postgres, Pulumi.</p>
<h3><a id="about-the-team" class="anchor"></a>About the team</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're a startup. It's unstructured.</li>
<li>Collectively founded more than a dozen venture-backed companies.</li>
<li>More than 10 different nationalities.</li>
<li>We deeply believe in <a href="https://supabase.com/blog/2022/03/25/should-i-open-source-my-company" target="_blank">the efficacy of collaborative open source</a>. We support existing communities and tools, rather than building "yet another xx".</li>
<li>We "dogfood" everything. If you use it in your project, we use it in Supabase.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="process" class="anchor"></a>Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>The entire process is fully remote and all communication will happen over email or via video chat.</li>
<li>Once you've submitted your application, the team will review your submission, and may reach out for a short screening interview over video call.</li>
<li>If you pass the screen you will be invited to up to four follow up interviews. The calls:
<ul>
<li>usually take between 20-45 minutes each depending on the interviewer.</li>
<li>are all 1:1.</li>
<li>will be with both founders, a member of either the growth or engineering team (depending on the role), and usually one other person from your immediate team or function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the interviews are over, the team will meet to discuss several roles and candidates and may:
<ul>
<li>ask one or two follow-up questions over email or a quick call.</li>
<li>go directly to making an offer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Ability to self-manage. Every company will expect you to self-manage to some degree, but Supabase takes this to a new level. We are a flat, early-stage startup without a lot of structure. To thrive in this environment, you’ll need to be a motivated self-starter who is good working asynchronously across multiple teams.

</ol>
<p><strong>What you’ll do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute to the development of our Rust projects, refining existing features and developing new ones.</li>
<li>Participate in the design and development of our PostgreSQL extensions and package index.</li>

<li>Interacting with customers on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Triage and fix GitHub issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Must haves</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3+ years experience in Rust development.</li>
<li>Experience with Git and version control practices.</li>
<li>Willingness to evolve and shape our development tools/stack.</li>
<li>Willingness to regularly talk to customers to ensure we’re solving problems they have.</li>
<li>Willingness to work in a fast-paced environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nice to haves</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience with PostgreSQL as a user and/or extension author.</li>
<li>Experience with GraphQL.</li>
<li>Experience working on a large, open-source projects.</li>
<li>Open source rust contributions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>100% remote work from anywhere in the world. No location-based adjustment to your salary.</li>
<li>ESOP (equity ownership in the company)</li>
<li>Autonomous work. We work collaboratively on projects, but you set your own pace.</li>
<li>Health, Vision and Dental benefits. Supabase covers 100% of the cost for employees and 80% for dependents</li>
<li>Generous Tech Allowance for any office setup you need</li>
<li>Annual Education Allowance</li>
<li>Annually run off-sites.</li>
</ul>

    

    <div class="content-conclusion"><h3>BUILD IN A WEEKEND. SCALE TO BILLIONS</h3>
<p>Supabase adds auth, realtime, and restful APIs to Postgres without a single line of code.</p>
<p>Each project within Supabase is an isolated&nbsp;Postgres cluster, allowing customers to scale independently, while still providing the features that you need to build: instant database setup, auth, row level security, realtime data streams, auto-generating APIs, and a simple to use web interface.</p>
<p>We are a fully remote company.</p>
<p>Key Tech: Javascript, Typescript, Go, Elixir, PostgREST (haskell), Postgres, Pulumi.</p>
<h3><a id="about-the-team" class="anchor"></a>About the team</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're a startup. It's unstructured.</li>
<li>Collectively founded more than a dozen venture-backed companies.</li>
<li>More than 10 different nationalities.</li>
<li>We deeply believe in <a href="https://supabase.com/blog/2022/03/25/should-i-open-source-my-company" target="_blank">the efficacy of collaborative open source</a>. We support existing communities and tools, rather than building "yet another xx".</li>
<li>We "dogfood" everything. If you use it in your project, we use it in Supabase.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="process" class="anchor"></a>Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>The entire process is fully remote and all communication will happen over email or via video chat.</li>
<li>Once you've submitted your application, the team will review your submission, and may reach out for a short screening interview over video call.</li>
<li>If you pass the screen you will be invited to up to four follow up interviews. The calls:
<ul>
<li>usually take between 20-45 minutes each depending on the interviewer.</li>
<li>are all 1:1.</li>
<li>will be with both founders, a member of either the growth or engineering team (depending on the role), and usually one other person from your immediate team or function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the interviews are over, the team will meet to discuss several roles and candidates and may:
<ul>
<li>ask one or two follow-up questions over email or a quick call.</li>
<li>go directly to making an offer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
