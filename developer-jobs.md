                <h2>About Clerk</h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">Clerk is on a mission to solve user management <strong>once and for all.</strong> We are a globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide developers with full-stack React components and hooks like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up">&lt;SignUp/&gt;</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in">&lt;SignIn/&gt;</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile">&lt;UserProfile/&gt;</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-user">useUser</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization">useOrganization</a>. These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization management flows. We believe that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4">a component is worth a thousand APIs</a>.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2>About the role</h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">Clerk is looking for a product-minded Technical Writer to educate clerk customers and drive developer adoption. This roll will have you working directly with our Product Engineering teams to define and execute the most interesting and engaging content for our community.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">The reason this job multiple title options is that it’s a little bit of both. At times you’ll be writing instructive educational material around ways to apply Clerk to customer’s problems and other times you’ll be asked to support the reference documentation that our customers rely on.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2>What you’ll do</h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">We’re a small but growing team with big ambitions. This means you’ll have responsibility far beyond closing out pre-sliced tickets. We’re looking for people that are comfortable writing about topics across the stack.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We will expect you to:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Collaborate with Product Engineers to magnify product releases</strong> - integrate into a world-class product delivery team that cares deeply about customer needs and the value of constant iteration.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Execute</strong> <em>-</em> Clerk values teammates who execute. That means approaching work iteratively and reducing the time between feedback cycles. This applies equally to technical writing as it does to product engineering.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Thrive in a dynamic environment</strong> <em>-</em> Clerk is not well suited for teammates who expect every task to be a series of predefined steps. We believe the best approach is to -work- through our customer’s problems in the trenches and not merely -think- through them from the sidelines. This means staying in touch with our community and identifying the right content gaps to fill.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><em><strong>Be Customer 0</strong></em> - Clerk is built on top of Clerk. That means the work you do to solve our internal projects likely will also become functionality that we release to customers as well. This is one of the most unique and exciting parts of Clerk. As a technical writer you’ll be asked to stay up-to-date with the latest features of Clerk and often being among the first to experiment with them.</p></li></ul><h2>Who you are</h2><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’re fluent in Javascript/Typescript and it’s modern tools and frameworks like Next.js, TanStack Start, etc</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have some Backend experience that allows you to write content for a full-stack audience)</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are excited to explore all the novel ways Clerk can be configured and implemented to</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You believe in solving real customer and community problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have a portfolio of developer-focused content that you’re proud of</p></li></ul><h2>Benefits</h2><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Competitive Salary</strong> – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Equity Ownership</strong> – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Work Gear</strong> - Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Flexible Vacation Policy</strong> – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Diverse and Inclusive Team</strong> – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.</p></li></ul>
