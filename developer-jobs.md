<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our mission</strong></p>

<p><strong>About the team</strong></p>
<p>We're looking for a <strong>Senior</strong> <strong>backend developer</strong> to join our cross-functional <strong>app team</strong>. You’ll build the backend to help us create a world where creating software is as easy and accessible as describing what you want and sharing your work is as simple as clicking a button.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">You’ll use <strong>TypeScript</strong> to design, build, and ship a <strong>completely new</strong> user-facing product in collaboration with product managers, designers, and developers.</li>
<li style="">You’ll develop scalable backend infrastructure with <strong>Bun</strong>, <strong>Node.js,</strong> and <strong>K8s</strong>.</li>
<li style="">You’ll build and operate <strong>APIs and infrastructure</strong>, taking operational ownership of the services.</li>

<li style=""><strong>You're framework-agnostic. </strong>You’re open to getting familiar with <strong>C# and .NET</strong> for parts of our backend stack.</li>
<li style=""><strong>You have a bias for action.</strong> You have a strong sense of urgency; when you see a problem, you solve it. You don't have time to waste on analysis paralysis and prefer to learn from your mistakes as you go.</li>
<li style=""><strong>You’re excited about AI and its potential.</strong> You’re deeply curious about AI and AI tooling and eager to explore how they can unlock new possibilities and make a real impact.</li>
<li style=""><strong>You’ve built and maintained APIs.</strong> You hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems, bringing a sound understanding of API design and best practices.</li>

<li style=""><strong>You ooze the values of the DevOps mindset.</strong> You’re intensely curious and passionate about running software in DevOps environments and eager to explore DevOps and SRE more.</li>
<li style=""><strong>You know a thing or two about architecture, containerization, and orchestration.</strong> You’re keen to learn/or use container systems like Docker, Kubernetes, and/or Platform as a Service.</li>
<li style=""><strong>You bring a strong sense of ownership</strong>. You believe in solving a problem entirely rather than simply shipping a solution. You operate autonomously and follow through on your commitments.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How we work</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">We ask you to be in the time zone UTC ±0 to UTC +2 for this role.</li>
<li style="">If you’re located outside this time zone range and want to move to the company’s official headquarters in Austria, we’ll handle the <strong>work permit process</strong> and cover travel expenses.</li>
<li style="">If you prefer to work outside your home, we offer a physical location in Vienna and <strong>co-working stipends</strong> in other cities.</li>
<li style="">We love <strong>working async.</strong> You can set your own pace and schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our global perks and benefits</strong></p>

<li style="">The chance to build a world-class product, positively impact millions of aspiring developers, and be a virtual owner of the company with <strong>equity</strong> (phantom stock).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our 4-step hiring process, in a nutshell</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">You’ll first have a video call with a member of the People team for a <strong>quick get-to-know chat.</strong></li>
<li style="">Then, <strong>you’ll be given a take-home challenge</strong> to work on. Don’t worry; we know you have many things on your plate and good things take time. You won’t be given a deadline.</li>
<li style="">Next <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">is the <strong>technical interview</strong> to show </span>your skills to the hiring manager.</li>
<li style="">Lastly, you’ll meet your <strong>potential future peers</strong> for a laid-back conversation.</li>
<li style="">If everything goes smoothly, you’ll receive an <strong>offer</strong> from us shortly after. Fingers crossed!</li>

                &lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who we are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating developers &lt;/strong&gt;with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🌎 The ideal candidate for this role will reside in San Francisco, California. Regular attendance at weekly Developer and AI events in the city is an essential aspect of this position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Required locations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;San Francisco, California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not subscribe to “I do my best work when I work 40 hours a week.” &amp;nbsp;People we hire at Sourcegraph believe that building outstanding things means working very hard — smarter and more hours than the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this job is exciting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Developer Advocate at Sourcegraph, you will be a champion for how developers understand and navigate complex codebases using our platform. You&#39;ll be connecting with the developer community and sharing the value of our AI Code Assistant and Code Search platform through written, video, and live engagements. You&#39;ll be part of a small but impactful team, representing Sourcegraph and its commitment to improving the developer experience. You&#39;ll have the opportunity to help developers at the most successful and sophisticated companies in the world (our customers) implement and scale code AI capabilities. We&#39;re looking for someone passionate about driving adoption and empowering engineers through creative story telling and genuine community building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Developer Advocate, you will spend 25% of your time engaging with Developers at events in-person and 75% of your time creating content and recording videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attend and host 2-5 meet-ups and events in San Francisco monthly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Represent our user community within Sourcegraph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build apps with Sourcegraph in public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build integrations on top of Sourcegraph (such as teaching Sourcegraph how to use and gather information from other dev tools, including logging, perf, etc., tools)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Livestream and record demos of what you build, for Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an incredibly helpful and inspirational member of our dev community yourself and help grow it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write awesome technical blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote Sourcegraph on social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help connect our user community growth to our product-led growth engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall, help define what dev advocacy means at Sourcegraph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills and experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Canonical seeks a Junior developer with a proven track record in Python and/or Go. As part of the Observability team, you will develop a cloud-native monitoring stack that composes best-in-class open-source monitoring tools. The stack is opinionated, resilient, and scalable, providing deep insights out of the box. The user experience is polished and seamless for the end-users, and its administrators will enjoy smooth, lightweight Day 1 and Day 2 operations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This is an exciting opportunity for a software engineer passionate about open source software, Linux, Kubernetes, and Observability. Build a rewarding, meaningful career working with the best and brightest people in technology at Canonical, the growing international software company behind Ubuntu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The monitoring stack will monitor applications running on a mix of cloud technologies such as Kubernetes and OpenStack, as well as bare-metal, virtual machines and containers. The stack will be capable of monitoring applications and infrastructure irrespective of whether they are operated by Juju, and will leverage multiple data sources at various levels of the architecture, including Juju itself, to contextualize the collected telemetry and insights delivered to the end-users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Our goal is to make developers orders of magnitude more efficient by becoming the operating system for modern development.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We give developers a sandbox to espouse their ideas. We are looking for someone who can let them know what is possible with the platform. We seek to make developers 100x more effective, and build 100x more impactful systems. Building leverage is a core part of what we do.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Oft an under-appreciated way to help developers build those levers is to focus on improving the speed and effectiveness of those developers.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong><u>About the role</u></strong></p><p style="min-height:1.5em">For this role, you will:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Implement programs to gather developer feedback and then exercise discretion on how to best communicate to those users</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Build and refine product adoption loops through content, improvements to the product, and nurturing community</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Assist the team on initiatives around our Open Source presence such as our CLI, Nixpacks, and Templates</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Craft resources that help grow the developer ecosystem and ensure that the experience for new and existing users is as seamless as possible</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">Dev Rel is an often misunderstood role, we see it as a hybrid of being able to make cool stuff and talking about it, but also being the tip of the spear in getting feedback from the market.

As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well.

A rare type of engineer that cares about talking to and advocating for customers, helping unblock them by fixing bugs or writing up sample code, and providing customers with guidance, pointers and support. We say <em>rare</em> because in our experience, most engineers aspire to architect large-scale systems or tackle deeply technical problems. Said differently, most engineers want to have influence over the <em>technology</em> they work on or with. There’s nothing wrong with that, we love hardcore engineers. There are many at LiveKit — we’re not complaining. But, this time, we’re looking for a new teammate that wants to have influence over our <em>product</em> and <em>business</em>. If you’d be energized by seeing a developer or team flip a LiveKit integration from staging to production—secretly satisfied in knowing you helped make it possible—you are perfect for this.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><p style="min-height:1.5em">*For clarity, this role is compensated like any other engineering role.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h3>As an Developer Success Engineer at LiveKit, you will:</h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Support and work directly with developers, teams, and companies building with LiveKit, both commercially and in the community.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Triage, file, and fix bugs, respond to support tickets, write sample and production-quality code, update documentation and author technical guides in service of customers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Regularly meet or follow-up with LiveKit customers to ensure their continued success on the platform.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Collaborate closely with Sales and Partnerships teams on strategy and support them in customer conversations.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2>About You</h2><h3>You'll thrive as an Developer Success Engineer if you:</h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are an engineer.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You don’t mind reading more code than you write.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’re a natural teacher.</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You find joy in helping others learn and succeed.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You can break down complex concepts in a way that’s easily understood by others.</p></li></ul></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have excellent spoken and written English.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You enjoy learning new programming languages (quickly) and prototyping.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Bonus Points</strong></h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’ve literally done this before.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have experience working with a community of developers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have contributions to OSS.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’ve built something with LiveKit.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">In those school group projects, you did most of the work (:sigh:).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’re multilingual — LiveKit has users around the world.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2>Our Commitments to You</h2><h3>We offer:</h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">A competitive salary and equity package.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Health, dental, and vision benefits</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Flexible vacations</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Remote work environment with necessary equipment provided.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h3>Ready to Apply?</h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">If you're excited about driving the future of AI-native communications and want to make a significant impact at a high-growth company, we'd love to hear from you.</p>

&lt;p&gt;We are Orderly, the ultimate destination for decentralized trading platforms. We are not satisfied with the limitations of centralized exchanges or the complexities of building decentralized order books. We aim to make trading easy, fast, and secure for everyone. How? By fusing the simplicity of CeFi with the power of DeFi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of the issue lies “liquidity”. Builders often grapple with a paradox; traders need liquidity, but liquidity demands traders. Our solution is simple as is bold –&lt;span class=&quot;text-primary-100 font-semibold&quot;&gt;concentrate all liquidity into one order book. One order book that connects all the liquidity in the crypto space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our ambition doesn&#39;t stop there. We&#39;re omnichain, championing chain abstraction. We envision seamless transactions, where the underlying blockchain is merely a detail. By concentrating liquidity, we aim to redefine the crypto landscape, making bridging and wrapped assets a thing of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are Orderly, and we are here to revolutionize DeFi, democratizing access to financial opportunities and fostering a fair, equitable paradigm for all.&lt;/p&gt;
