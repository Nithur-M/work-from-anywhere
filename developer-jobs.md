                &lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About AssemblyAI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At AssemblyAI, we’re building at the forefront of Speech AI, creating powerful models for speech-to-text and speech understanding available through a straightforward API. With more than 200,000 developers building on our API and over 5,000 paying customers, AssemblyAI is helping unlock and support the next generation of powerful, meaningful products built with AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress in AI is moving at an unprecedented pace– and our team is made up of experts in AI research that are focused on making sure that our customers are able to stay on the cutting edge, with production-ready AI models that are constantly updating and improving as our team continues to improve accuracy, latency, and what’s possible with Speech AI. Our models consistently rank highest in industry benchmarks for accuracy, outperforming models from Google and Amazon, and up to 30% fewer hallucinations than OpenAI’s Whisper. Our models power more than 2 billion end-user experiences each day, helping companies better understand customer feedback, run more productive meetings with automated meeting notes, and helping improve childhood literacy via ed tech tools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve raised funding by leading investors including Accel, Insight Partners, Y Combinator’s AI Fund, Patrick and John Collision, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross. We’re a remote team looking to build one of the next great AI companies, and are looking for driven, talented people to help us get there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re seeking a technical content and social creator who’s deeply embedded in the AI space and excited about what’s possible with Voice AI. This is a highly creative, high-visibility role that blends technical fluency with social connection, community creation, and storytelling instinct.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll help AssemblyAI break through the noise and be seen as a leader in the conversation around Voice AI on social channels like Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and YouTube. You’ll own our overall social strategy, creating programs that fit our audience and goals for each channel, and be a public face of AssemblyAI, creating YouTube videos that showcase what’s possible with the AssemblyAI platform and the applications that our customers are building.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the perfect role for someone who is deeply passionate about AI and staying up to date on the latest trends, insights, and conversations happening in the space, who is opinionated about what content resonates with forward thinking developers and startup founders, and loves marrying technical skill with content creation. Whether it’s building a quick prototype to show Speech AI in action, reacting to a viral moment in the AI ecosystem, or hosting a livestream to showcase what customers are building with AssemblyAI— you’ll play a key role in shaping how developers discover, understand, and build with AssemblyAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create educational and social-first content — including tutorials, demos, short-form videos, livestreams, and explainers that showcase what’s possible with Voice AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act as the on-camera voice for AssemblyAI’s developer content, walking through real-world use cases, creative applications, and trends in the industry in a way that will resonate with the community and help build AssemblyAI’s brand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build, demo, and share lightweight apps and prototypes that bring Speech AI to life in practical, inspiring ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partner with Product Marketing and Growth to turn new features and product updates into engaging social content that will capture the Voice AI industry’s attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay plugged into AI and developer communities across Twitter/X, YouTube, Reddit, and newsletters — spotting emerging trends, tools, and topics before they peak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pitch timely, creative ideas that position AssemblyAI at the center of developer and AI conversations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own your projects end-to-end — from concept and scripting to production and publishing — ensuring consistent quality and alignment across teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with Marketing, Customer Experience, Applied AI, and external creators to deliver cohesive, cross-channel storytelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Need:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of developer and AI culture. You’re active online, know what’s trending, and opinionated on where AI is going and what high quality content looks like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working with and creating content for a technical audience. You know how to speak to developers (and ideally are one yourself) and can create programs that feel engaging and authentic, not marketing-y or disingenuous&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience recording and editing short-form and long-form video and are constantly testing the newest AI video tools to help you try new ideas and speed up production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience producing and editing video content specifically for a YouTube audience&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical literacy: you can use APIs, build simple demos, and explain technical concepts clearly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable being on camera, with an authentic and engaging presence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent creative instincts, storytelling ability, and project management skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio of video/demo work that demonstrates your storytelling, technical clarity, and production quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contract and Conversion Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a project-based contract role&lt;/strong&gt; –&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;starting at an estimated 15-20 hours per week for 3-6 months, with potential to convert to full-time, based on performance and business needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Fully remote, ideally U.S. (SF or NY a plus!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools &amp;amp; resources:&lt;/strong&gt; access to our API, engineering support, design assets, existing documentation, and brand guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay Transparency:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AssemblyAI strives to recruit and retain exceptional talent from diverse backgrounds while ensuring pay equity for our team. Our salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our size, stage, and industry, and are one part of many compensation, benefit, and other reward opportunities we provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many factors that go into salary determinations, including relevant experience, skill level, qualifications assessed during the interview process, and maintaining internal equity with peers on the team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Working at AssemblyAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a small but mighty group of startup veterans and experienced AI researchers with over 20 years of expertise in Machine Learning, Speech Recognition, and NLP. As a fully remote team, we’re looking for people to join our team who are ambitious, curious, and lead with integrity. We’re still in the early days of AI and of AssemblyAI’s journey, and are looking for teammates who won’t just fit in, but will help us define and build our company culture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re committed to creating a space where our employees can bring their full selves to work and have equal opportunity to succeed. No matter your race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, origin, ability, age, veteran status, if joining this mission speaks to you, we encourage you to apply!&lt;/p&gt;
