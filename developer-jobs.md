Our goal is to make developers orders of magnitude more efficient by becoming the operating system for modern development.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We give developers a sandbox to espouse their ideas. We are looking for someone who can let them know what is possible with the platform. We seek to make developers 100x more effective, and build 100x more impactful systems. Building leverage is a core part of what we do.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Oft an under-appreciated way to help developers build those levers is to focus on improving the speed and effectiveness of those developers.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong><u>About the role</u></strong></p><p style="min-height:1.5em">For this role, you will:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Implement programs to gather developer feedback and then exercise discretion on how to best communicate to those users</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Build and refine product adoption loops through content, improvements to the product, and nurturing community</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Assist the team on initiatives around our Open Source presence such as our CLI, Nixpacks, and Templates</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Craft resources that help grow the developer ecosystem and ensure that the experience for new and existing users is as seamless as possible</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">Dev Rel is an often misunderstood role, we see it as a hybrid of being able to make cool stuff and talking about it, but also being the tip of the spear in getting feedback from the market. You should be knowledgeable about modern DevOps practices, the state of the cloud infra world, while being opinionated about how the next 10 years of Dev Tools should look like.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">This is a high impact, high agency role where you are given a high degree of autonomy to work with any function you desire while receiving any support from the team you need.

As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well.

                <h2>LiveKit Developer Success Engineering</h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">This isn’t one of those situations where we tack “engineer” onto the back of every role at LiveKit. No. We’re actually looking for an <em>engineer</em>*. A rare type of engineer that cares about talking to and advocating for customers, helping unblock them by fixing bugs or writing up sample code, and providing customers with guidance, pointers and support. We say <em>rare</em> because in our experience, most engineers aspire to architect large-scale systems or tackle deeply technical problems. Said differently, most engineers want to have influence over the <em>technology</em> they work on or with. There’s nothing wrong with that, we love hardcore engineers. There are many at LiveKit — we’re not complaining. But, this time, we’re looking for a new teammate that wants to have influence over our <em>product</em> and <em>business</em>.
