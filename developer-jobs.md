A black hole for many, a goldmine for few. However, these bots should be leveraged by a lot more people, because, well, they frigging work wonders. ;-) While the early adopters have been mining cryptos since the beginning. HODLING their investments for the big win. You might still be HOLDING on to your traditional savings, thinking the crypto-ship has sailedÃ¢â¬Â¦</b></p><p><b>But hey ho, hell no. There is crypto-hope on the horizon. And we invite you to embark on our mission to simplify and clarify our Ã¢â¬ËmysteriousÃ¢â¬â¢ product. To all. Including yourself, your friends, (grand)parents and that nerdy nephew who keeps pestering you with terms like FOMO, FUD and Satoshi. Take those shitcoins and run, kiddo!</b>ÃÂ </p><br><h1>Forecast: raining FOMO</h1><p>Do you ever trust the weatherman? Neither do we. But we do trust the unbeatable experts on our Cryptohopper team. And they predicted FOMO season is coming. Of course you may think this is a far-fetched prophecy. But weÃ¢â¬â¢ve been back-testing our gut feeling since the early days and we were rarely wrong. So. Buckle up. We prepare for storm.<br></p><br><h1>Android App Developer?</h1><p>Turn right if you want to develop an edge-of-your-seat app that creates an awesome experience for our traders. Prepare to snuggle up (currently not too closely) to our product teams, so you can build (and run, and love) the exact app our users need to trade on cryptocurrency markets. To succeed, you have to be versed in Kotlin and Java, and willing to get up close and personal with up-and-coming tooling. Including tech that you introduce to the stack. This is the perfect position if you combine Ã¢â¬ËhardcoreÃ¢â¬â¢ coding skills with a Ã¢â¬Ësecurity firstÃ¢â¬â¢ mindset and are excited to learn about crypto trading and blockchain technologies<br></p><br><h1>Hi, we're the stack.</h1><p>Kotlin and Java, JUnit, Truth,ÃÂ RESTful APIs, Git, Bitrise.</p><br><h1>You know you got this if.<br>
</h1><ul>
<li>You have 3+ years of experience as an Android Native app developer</li>
<li><p>You dream about Kotlin, Java, Android's design principles and application interface guidelines</p></li>
<li><p>Your lunch break experiments sometimes get out of hand. One time you accidentally developed an app that correlated caffeine intake with sock funkiness. And it worked<br></p></li>
<li><p>You have knowledge of automation and testing methodologies used for automated testing (JUnit, Truth), familiar with RESTful API's, offline storage, threading and perfomance tuningÃÂ </p></li>
<li><p>Proficient in code versioning tools such as Git and familiair withÃÂ push notifications, APIs, and cloud messaging</p></li>
<li><p>Experience with continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) solutions such as Bitrise</p></li>
                </ul><br><h1>What we offer.</h1><p>A mission-driven culture with a great work/life balance and a good benefits package. Sure, we work hard to get sh*t done, but we also regularly push our moustache (sorry, itÃ¢â¬â¢s a silly joke for Dutch readers) for a VR gaming session, picnics in the park, indoor bouldering, drinks at the pub, live DJ sessions and whatever happens in our (wo)man cave - and probably best stays there. The setting aside, we also:</p><ul>
<li>Pay you (pinky promise!): between EUR 55K and 75K per year [skill dependent]</li>
<li>Allow you to work wherever, including 2 days at our Amsterdam HQ </li>
<li>Send you on your merry way for 25 days each year, minimum (more is negotiable)</li>
<li>Provide you with great gear; a high-end laptop and whatever else you need to succeed. Perhaps an AI-driven desk chair that *knows* when you want to lean back?</li>
<li>Lifetime Cryptohopper subscription (if you donÃ¢â¬â¢t break our BFF vows)</li>
<li>Shower you with extras, like trading benefits, a generous training budget, and (mom will be proud!) the opportunity to work in a domain that accelerates financial inclusion for the unbanked</li>
<li>Pour you a stiff drink on Fridays, coffee that wonÃ¢â¬â¢t make you wish you chose tea, and lots of mind-blowing feedback on your work, hobbyÃ¢â¬â¢s, and pets. And we sincerely look forward to hearing whatÃ¢â¬â¢s on your mind, too.</li>
</ul><br><p></p><h1>Ready to virtually meet our engineers?</h1><p>We donÃ¢â¬â¢t require (in fact, please donÃ¢â¬â¢t) a motivation letter; weÃ¢â¬â¢d rather have a good chat and tell you everything you want to know. About life, the universe, and everything! Mail your resume to hr@cryptohopper.com. More information?

<p>We are seeking an experienced Full-Stack Engineer to join our product team and help develop cutting-edge technology for our rapidly growing vacation rental management company. Our vision is to provide the attention to detail and personal care of a small, local company backed by an industry-leading technology suite.  </p>
<p><br><strong>Product Highlights</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some of our custom built products include:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Internal Admin Tool - A dashboard that syncs data from our property management software (PMS) via API such as reservation details, reservation financial information and more. This application allows us to organize hundreds of thousands of data points, build new applications and two-way communicates with our property management software.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Pricing - An algorithm that allows us to set pricing rulesets and daily rates for over 200 properties. The backend system on the LocalVR Admin Tool is operated by our revenue management team who constantly monitor and adjust the rules to meet homeowner revenue expectations as well as the market at any given time. The adjustments flow back into our PMS via API. We've conducted multiple case studies that proves LocalVR Pricing outperforms competitors up to 100% in year over year comparison. This pricing application is a cornerstone of our service offering.</li></ul>
<ul> <li>Owner's Portal - This application is client-facing and allows our clients, the homeowner, to login and access specific information about their property. Homeowners have the ability to see their properties calendar, revenue metrics, financial statements, book their own stay, submit maintenance requests and more in a sleek and user friendly manner.</li> </ul>
<ul> <li>Finance Application - Accounting in our industry is very complex and begins to get very complicated as you scale. This application allows us to organize the data we receive from our PMS, apply different financial rules and deliver precise monthly financial summaries, or "Owner Statements", with a breakdown of any given month's reservation financial information to our clients. Statements are generated and organized automatically for each homeowner. Once approved by our team, each statement is emailed to the related client. We then process payment for each client using an integration with Stripe.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<p>In this role, you will be responsible for designing, testing, and implementing software using the Django Python framework and React/Next.js JavaScript frameworks. The ideal candidate will have at least 3 years of software development experience with these frameworks and be comfortable working independently in a fast-paced environment. Familiarity with agile development practices (such as Kanban or Scrum), Git, and writing functional QA tests and unit tests is required.<br><br>Experience with PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, Docker, Celery, and managing CI/CD pipelines is not required, but would be a plus.<br><br>You will be joining a small team of dedicated back-end and front-end engineers, as well as a Sr. Product Manager, to help deliver on our strategic roadmap. If you are passionate about developing innovative technology, we want to hear from you.<br><br><strong>Location(s)</strong></p>
<ul> <li><strong>Latin America</strong></li> <li><strong>South America</strong></li> </ul>
<p>Note: This position requires availability for stand-ups and scrum meetings that typically occur between 9:00am and 12:00pm MST on weekdays.</p>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
