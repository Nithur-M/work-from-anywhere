<div><strong>About the Job at PostPilot.com / Handwrite.io </strong></div><div>You’ll pitch in on building our <strong>Ruby on Rails + Hotwire app(s)</strong> as we continue to grow, add new features, keep them fast, and ratchet up their reliability &amp; robustness. <br><br>At PostPilot we build our product following the Basecamp <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a> methodology and keep our apps fast, secure, and reliable. Right now, we're hoping to further develop our flagship product PostPilot and work on problems like A/B testing, MFA, Adding more e-commerce integrations, building external APIs, and of course, making sure our existing infrastructure is scalable and maintained. </div><div><br></div><div>This position includes building features, deep-dive debugging, internal tooling, web performance, and internal support, with a bit of Robots and hardware thrown in. Day in and day out you’ll get to the bottom of multiple different issues across the stack and across projects. You can expect an <strong>inclusive, eager small team (of 4 devs)</strong> team who’ll support you in it, rise to challenges with you, and grow together. </div><div><br></div><div>Here are real examples of the work we’ve done lately that might help you to get a better idea of what this job entails:</div><ul>
<li>Built a way for email lists to be converted into physical mailable addresses. </li>
<li>Built software to manage pulling, printing, and monitoring our in-house printshop manufacturing process.</li>
<li>Built a fleet of handwriting <strong>robots</strong> driven by Ruby on Rails.</li>
<li>Built support for single-use unique coupon codes in <strong>direct mail campaigns</strong> </li>
<li>Built the ability for <strong>Shopify</strong> brands (our users) to send real handwritten notes (postcards in envelopes, with real pens) with live in-browser previews</li>
<li>Created a Public API for sending <strong>postcards</strong> and <strong>handwritten notes</strong> in our production facility.</li>
<li>Developing a load balancing strategy for “expensive” <strong>Sidekiq</strong> background jobs that were crushing<strong> external APIs</strong> and our queues.</li>
<li>Improved developer experience with <strong>Heroku</strong> (Pipelines, CI, and Review apps), <strong>Github</strong> Actions</li>
<li>Deep dive into expensive queries in our application and working to improve performance and memory consumption from <strong>Postgres</strong> to Rails</li>
<li>Built a <strong>webhook</strong> event publishing system for events from our production facility.</li>
<li>Upgraded our main application to <strong>Rails 7 with import maps and hotwire</strong>.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>About you</strong></div><div>We’re looking for candidates who are ready for a similar breadth and depth of work. There are a lot of areas of responsibility! Solid fundamentals with software development, systems, troubleshooting, and teamwork pave the way.</div><div><br></div><div>We value people who have an opinion but can commit even if they disagree. People who understand the value of others being heard. This is only possible with direct feedback, openness to each others’ experiences, and willingness to show up for each other.</div><div><br></div><div>You can expect a team that listens, and to be heard. You can expect to be counted on. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here. This is a remote-friendly job. You’re free to work where you work best. The bulk of our work is written via Slack and Github, from pull request discussions to team chats, and video recordings with a few video calls thrown in. </div><div>
<br><strong>We require an overlap at least 4 hours</strong> with the United States east coast workday. That said, we’re not hiring from locations that require a graveyard shift to make the overlap happen.<br><br><strong>Pay and benefits</strong><br>The annual salary for this position is $80,000 - $120,000 USD. Applicants from outside the US will be offered a contractor role with comparable terms and at the same rate of pay as our US-based employees. <br><br>Our target start date for our new hire is as soon as possible.<br><br><strong>How to apply</strong><br>Please send a quick message tailored to this position that speaks to us.  Include the phrase "Ghostbusters!" and we'll know you're a real person that made it this far. Introduce yourself to us as a colleague. Give us some examples of how you’ve been successful in the past and attach a resume.<br><br>You should expect to hear from us fairly quickly. After that, there are 3 phases of the process. </div><ol>
<li>A quick call to learn more about each other. <em>Expect a 30-minute call.</em>
</li>
<li>A take-home exercise, our ​​technical exercise is representative of the kind of day-to-day work we do with a follow-up code walkthrough call. <em>Plan for around 4 hours for the exercise and 30-minutes for the follow-up.</em>
</li>
<li>One last call with one of our Founders and the CEO of the company. <em>Expect this to take 20-minutes.</em> </li>
</ol><div> Our interviews are conversations held over video with future colleagues – no tests, no surprises! </div><div><br></div>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul>
