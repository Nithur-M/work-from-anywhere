<div>This position is for a Senior Software Developer, plus a little. You should be an expert in PHP and Javascript, comfortable writing and reviewing code for a sizable existing code base, and capable of occasionally mentoring and supporting junior developers. You should also have experience running a complex system with high levels of uptime.<br><br>The compensation for this role is $80k - $130k USD.<br><br><strong>About Us</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>We're a small team, half technical, half not so technical.</li>
<li>We're fully-remote with team members in time zones around the world.</li>
<li>We've been in business for over 10 years and we're profitable.</li>
<li>We offer flexible hours and vacation time.</li>
</ul><div><strong>What The Job Is</strong></div><ul>
<li>Writing, testing, and debugging PHP (Laravel) and Javascript (React) for our internal domain management system and marketing sites.</li>
<li>Integrating with third party APIs and web scraping.</li>
<li>Light project management. You should be comfortable assembling and creating epics and breaking them into smaller deliverables.</li>
<li>Sometimes becoming the resident expert on new subjects or technologies. You may be asked to figure out how we might use a new technology to help inform decisions about the company's direction.</li>
<li>Helping out across the entire company. You'll help share the load with things like dealing with vendors, monitoring logs and verifying things are running as they should, supporting our internal teams with ad-hoc SQL queries, managing contractor deliverables, and being the go-to person for questions.</li>
</ul><div><strong>Requirements</strong></div><ul>
<li>7+ years of experience with PHP, Laravel, Javascript, and React.</li>
<li>Comfortable working with Docker, git, MySQL/MariaDB.</li>
<li>Excellent written communication skills.</li>
<li>A self-starter attitude and the willingness to chip in where needed.</li>
</ul><div><strong>Pluses</strong></div><ul>
<li>Database design, optimization.</li>
<li>AWS operations and configuration (Terraform, Ansible, Packer).</li>
<li>Solo entrepreneur experience.</li>
<li>UI/UX, design, or marketing experience.</li>
</ul><div><strong>This Job is Right For You if</strong></div><ul>
<li>You know your way around software development from soup to nuts. You've created, deployed, and maintained a large system with high uptime requirements, large databases, and lots of moving parts.</li>
<li>You're self-motivated and like to jump right in; there isn't anybody looking over your shoulder.</li>
<li>You feel a sense of ownership of your code. There is no QA team on the other side of the wall -- you're the last person between writing the code and supporting it.</li>
<li>You respect Chesterton's Fence. Our codebase spans a decade and you strive to thoroughly understand a problem before you implement solutions.</li>
</ul><div>If you're a good fit, please send your resume and a couple paragraphs about how your experience applies to this role to <strong>newjobs</strong><a href="mailto:whoever@domainmarket.com"><strong>@domainmarket.com</strong></a>. We look forward to hearing from you!</div><div>

<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="">
<li style=""><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li style=""><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">https://build.a.team/remotivereferral</a> + mention Remotive. </span>No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>What you’ll do:</strong></span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="">
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="">
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </span></p>
