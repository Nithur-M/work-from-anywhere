<strong># Introduction<br></strong><br>We are a SaaS ticketing platform that is very excited about the future. Covid impacted our industry, but we are now out the other side and plan to grow our team to help accelerate this future.<br><br>Coming out of the pandemic, we completed an exciting evolution of our platform. This involved moving from a traditional RoR architecture to a modern "single page application" (SPA), exposing our application as a set of APIs consumed by Ember to provide a rich interactive experience.<br><br>Completing this work allows us to focus on new feature development in the coming years. We have already seen the benefits of the new platform in terms of productivity and speed of rolling out new features.<br><br>To accelerate this potential and deliver on an ambitious product roadmap, we want to expand our backend team with new people to cover Ruby and Ruby on Rails server development. In terms of experience, we are looking for experienced developers comfortable working with a large codebase and a complex domain.<br><br>The work will be a mixture of new feature development exposed as APIs for the front-end development team and infrastructure-focused improvements on our backend.<br><br>The feature areas we focus on are significant enhancements to our CRM functionality, improvements to our public API and investment in Business Intelligence and Analytics. In addition, in the medium to longer term, we are researching how best to integrate AI technologies into our platform.<br><br><strong># Skills &amp; Requirements<br></strong><br>- 4+ years experience developing web applications<br><br>- Experience with programming Ruby/Rails required with the role focused on server development<br><br>- Experience with Chef and Terraform a bonus<br><br>- Strong programming skills with a focus on clean design, well-refactored code and automated testing<br><br>- Understanding of front-end technologies: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JS frameworks like React/Ember are welcomed but not required<br><br>- Experience with Busines Intelligence and Analytics is also welcomed but  not required<br><br>- Comfortable working as part of a fully remote dev team.<br><br><strong># Technologies we use<br></strong><br>- Ruby on Rails is our primary server framework evolving towards pure API server<br><br>- EmberJs is our primary front-end development framework<br><br>- JSONAPI::Resources, http://jsonapi-resources.com/, is how we are building our APIs<br><br>- MySQL / Redis are our primary storage engines<br><br>- All our servers are Ubuntu based managed through CHEF<br><br>- Deployed on AWS using terraform for managing infrastructure<br><br>- GitHub for source code management and process support<br><br>- GitHub actions for continuous integration<br><br><strong># How we work<br></strong><br>We run a lightweight process that focuses on feature-based weekly delivery. Our coordination and communication are mostly through daily 'catch-up meetings' and appropriate tools such as Trello for backlog management, Slack for communication and Git(GitHub) for source control and feature deployment through PRs and Milestones.<br><br>From a coding perspective, we strongly emphasise clean, minimal, well-refactored code backed up by a robust suite of automated tests. In addition, we use peer review for all design and development work.<br><br>In general, we strive for an approach that empowers and trusts individuals to 'do the right thing', and as a team, we try and keep each other true to this.<br><br><strong># 100% Remote working<br></strong><br>Our development team works remotely with members in Austria, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Brazil, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Our wider organisation has people based in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Dublin is our headquarters and main office - with the core Support team and Sales and Marketing team.<br><br>Remote working has been part of our company's DNA since our founding. We believe it offers many advantages to both Ticketsolve and its employees. This culture means you should be comfortable working as part of a fully remote team.<br><br>Important to note that time zones are a consideration for us with remote working. Our experience is that European, some Asian and East Latin American time zones are preferable, allowing for collaboration at reasonable times.<br><br><strong># Recruitment process<br></strong><br>We are initially looking for resumes and portfolio examples of your work, e.g., GitHub repositories, blog articles, etc. If you do not have anything suitable, don't worry. As part of the process, we will introduce some coding tasks, e.g., code reviews, whiteboard design sessions, and pair programming.<br><br>From there, we filter down and do a series of remote interviews. We start with an introduction call to explain the project and answer questions. From there, we will have a mixture of technical and culture-fit calls. <br>Our preference is for candidates to talk to as much of the team as possible so that we, the team and the candidate, can make the best decision possible. We will also look at facilitating face-to-face meetings if appropriate and makes sense.<br><br>After this stage, we will be in a position to make a formal offer.<br><br>Please submit resumes to **jobs@ticketsolve.com** with the subject **"Job Application"**. Please note that we will not respond to all applications due to the volume of applications but instead make contact when there is a potential fit.</div>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
