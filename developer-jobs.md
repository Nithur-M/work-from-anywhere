<p>Join a team dedicated to creating products people love as a Remote Senior React Native Developer</p>
<p>We're growing and looking for an experienced Developer with significant React Native experience to join our team, and to help us to evolve our React Native offering.</p>
<p>You'll work directly with clients on projects as a Senior React Native Developer, guiding by example with your communication and advocating for how we work as consultants, especially in difficult situations. You'll partner closely with product managers, designers, developers, and clients to help solve problems.</p>
<p>You'll deliver high-quality, well-tested software, mentor both client and thoughtbot engineering teams in software best practices, and advise on product prioritization, agile process, team culture, and communication.</p>
<p>During investment time, you'll contribute to the broader tech community, thoughtbot, and yourself. The majority of thoughtbot's<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot" class="external"> open-source work</a> and<a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog" class="external"> blog content</a> is the result of investment time.</p>
<p>This is a remote position on the <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/lift-off" class="external">Lift Off</a> team, which staffs cross-functional project teams with deep expertise in new product development, that provides clients with expert product strategy, risk management, and cross-functional expertise.</p>
<p>thoughtbot is a fully remote company. Because we're looking for teammates who overlap with our clients' teams working hours, this is a remote position available to anyone throughout the Americas (UTC-3 through UTC-10).</p>
<p><strong>We will begin reviewing applications for this role no sooner than </strong><strong>September 23, 2022.</strong><br></p>
<h3><br></h3>
<h3>Salary</h3>
<p>Salary and benefits vary by location and country. You can view the compensation and benefits for where you live at <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/jobs/compensation?department=Development&amp;title=Senior+Developer" class="external">https://thoughtbot.com/jobs/compensation?department=Development&amp;title=Senior+Developer</a></p>
<h3><br></h3>
<h3>About thoughtbot</h3>
<p>We believe that it is possible to continuously learn and improve the way people work while building higher-quality products that make positive contributions to the world. We work with companies in every step of the product development and maintenance process to help identify and solve problems. We lead and participate in product design sprints, build high-quality apps, and then deploy them.</p>
<p>We proactively work on improving diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) at thoughtbot. We aim to maintain an inclusive work environment where everyone can thrive professionally, as well as have full lives outside of work. Read about our DEI efforts in the <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/playbook/our-company/diversity-equity-and-inclusion" class="external">Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</a> section of our Playbook. We acknowledge that DEI work is never done, and that we will make mistakes along the way. We are continuously working on learning, improving ourselves, and the company.</p>
<p>As a member of thoughtbot, you'll be part of our distributed remote community. We're continuously working to assure remote work is inclusive, collaborative, comfortable, and social.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Senior React Native Developers at thoughtbot are able to build high-quality, test-driven cross-platform mobile applications using React Native and Typescript.</p>
<p>While React Native is a must, additional experience or interest in native mobile development, such as iOS with Swift or Android with Kotlin, or web development, especially with Ruby on Rails or React, is a big plus.</p>
<p>Well-qualified candidates will have in-depth experience with mobile development and related technologies, patterns, and tools. They will have knowledge of the differences in navigation and interaction design on iOS and Android, and be comfortable with managing the Google Play and Apple App Store submission and review processes.</p>
<p>As consultants, we work closely with our clients. Experience with a client-facing role like consulting, teaching, or business development is also valuable, but not required.</p>
<p>Well-qualified candidates value diversity, equity, and inclusion, and contributing to an inclusive working and learning environment.</p>
<p>We especially appreciate candidates that demonstrate commitment to valuing DEI and contributing to an inclusive working and learning environment. We also understand that not everyone has had the opportunity to commit to this work, and that's okay.</p>
<p>We encourage you to apply even if you don't match 100% of the requirements. Let us know if you need any specific accommodations during the interview process.</p>
<p><strong>thoughtbot cannot sponsor work visas at this time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p><strong>Benefits vary by location.</strong></p>

We cover disability insurance and basic life insurance with the opportunity to buy up. We also offer a comprehensive 401(k) plan with company match and immediate vesting. Team members accrue 20 paid vacation days and receive 11 paid holidays per year in addition to 10 paid sick days. New parents receive at least 6 weeks of paid parental leave, as well as the ability to take up to 6 months off.</p>

We also reserve at least 4 weeks per year for investing in ourselves, the company, and our community. Everything we do is predicated on having a great team and a culture of growing. We use the latest technologies and are always down to try new methods on both internal and client projects.</p> <p>thoughtbot does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> Fully remote company (worldwide, incorporated in Berlin)
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://opencraft.com/">https://opencraft.com/</a>
</p>

<div>Do you care about contributing to open-source, and appreciate a good challenge? We do too! :) <br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Open-source<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are a team of veteran open-source developers, working on educational and community-based projects in an<a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/open_first/"> open-first</a> environment – and we are looking for new members. By joining us, you will work full-time on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums. </div><div>
<br>We care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.</div><div>
<br><strong>Remote-first</strong>
</div><div>
<br>Unlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it’s none of our business when or where you work from. :)</div><div>
<br>We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!). We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good documentation practices.</div><div>
<br><strong>Online education<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are one of the main contributors to the <a href="https://open.edx.org/">Open edX project</a>, the main open-source MOOC platform created by MIT, Harvard and many other top universities. It powers sites like <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, the <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library">MIT Open Learning Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fun-mooc.fr/">national online learning platform for France</a>. We provide development and hosting for institutions like <a href="https://onlinelearning.hms.harvard.edu/hmx/">Harvard Medical School</a>, <a href="https://www.labxchange.org">Harvard LabXchange</a>, <a href="https://ondemand.cloudera.com">Cloudera</a>, <a href="https://www.upskill.autodesk.com">Autodesk</a>, and several governments. We are not affiliated with <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, but we contribute and work with them on various projects. </div><div>
<br><strong>Technical stack</strong><br><br>
</div><div>The Open edX project is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. Tasks are varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working full-stack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Contracting terms<br></strong><br>
</div><div>This is a full-time, permanent contract position. We aim for long-term relationships -- once in, almost all team members stay for many years. </div><div><br></div><div>We care about paying fairly: </div><ul>
<li>Team members set their own compensation level, which is paid based on hours worked (no unpaid overtime!). </li>
<li>When determining your rate, we will expect you to factor in benefits (vacation, healthcare, purchase budgets, etc.) - the idea is to let <em>you</em> pick the benefits that are useful to you, rather than offer one-size-fits-all packages that aren’t always very valuable.</li>
<li>We also proactively apply generous raises team-wide, based on the company results at the end of each year. <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/team_compensation/">See the details about how we approach compensation in our handbook</a>.</li>
</ul><div>We also firmly believe in work-life balance: as long as you deliver what you commit to, there is a lot of latitude in how much work you can choose to accept. We are open to time commitments anywhere in the 30h to 40h/week range, and highly discourage working more than that. It’s important to have time to ourselves, as well as having some slack, and there are diminishing returns in working more anyway. We are currently recruiting precisely to preserve that balance, and ensure we have plenty of capacity to handle our projects.</div><div><br></div><div>We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.</div><div>
<br><strong>Basic Requirements:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Experience with contributing to free software projects - small contributions are completely fine, but you <em>must</em> have at least one patch or pull request merged in a third-party project, or been a maintainer of an open source project with significant adoption. (Note that you can contribute now to satisfy this requirement - see for example the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/build-test-release-wg/projects/1">Open edX release issues</a>, fixing one of these issues guarantees an interview.)</li>
<li>Senior developer with 3+ years working with Python</li>
<li>Experience with Python web frameworks, specifically Django</li>
<li>3+ years of HTML, Javascript, and CSS (experience with React and/or Typescript is a big plus!)</li>
<li>Experience with unit testing</li>
<li>Comfortable working in a Linux environment, specifically Debian or Ubuntu</li>
<li>Experience with databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Additional Skills:</strong><br><br>
</div><div>You will work on tasks from the following categories, but you can pick up the skills on the job if you haven't mastered these yet:</div><ul>
<li>DevOps experience, especially on Debian/Ubuntu servers, Terraform, Vault, Packer, Prometheus, ELK, Docker. We are building a modern infrastructure and having a strong DevOps presence on top of core software engineering skills is a big plus with us.</li>
<li>Cloud computing, like AWS or OpenStack</li>
<li>Configuration management tools such as Ansible, Consul</li>
<li>RabbitMQ, Redis &amp; Elasticsearch</li>
<li>Mobile development (iOS and/or Android)</li>
<li>Managing clients &amp; projects from beginning to completion (senior developer)</li>
<li>Public speaking at conferences (you would present a talk every year at the Open edX Con)</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Apply for this Position</strong><br><br>
</div><div>Our recruitment process differs from most other companies - we don’t believe resumes and the traditional interviews to be particularly effective. Often, they tell more about how good someone is at interviewing, rather than at the actual work. So, our initial interview is lighter and easier to pass than in other companies - but we then provide you with real (and paid!) work to see how it works out in reality.</div><ul>
<li>Step 1: You apply by filling out this form: <a href="https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/">https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/</a> </li>
<li>Step 2: We do two interviews with candidates matching the requirements listed above. The first interview includes a (simple) coding exercise.</li>
<li>Step 3: If this works out, we hire you!

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>

It was started back in 2013, and since then we’ve relentlessly increased code quality, features and test coverage, and are proud to say that we have almost zero legacy code or technical debt. We believe a modular monolithic architecture can reach a <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">level of perfection</strong> where it’s <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">superior to a micro-service architecture</strong> — despite an ever-increasing number of features.</p>
