                &lt;p&gt;Timescale is looking for a Developer Advocate to represent our products in technical communities around the world. A Developer Advocate is a developer’s best friend. We are engineers with experience building the kinds of systems we advocate for. We are leaders and earnest participants in the developer community. We care deeply about inclusion and providing a positive experience for all developers everywhere we go. At Timescale, Developer Advocates are passionate stewards not only for Timescale’s products but also for PostgreSQL. We believe in Postgres for Everything, and you should too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this role, you’ll build amazing online content (articles, videos, blog posts) for Timescale as well as third-party developer sites and publications. You’ll build long-lasting relationships with community leaders around the world, establishing your own brand as a Timescale expert, a PostgreSQL expert, and a time-series expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current need is for content (blog posts, videos, and benchmarks), especially around Timescale use cases and the verticals to which we can help. If you’ve got experience with IoT data, event streams, time-series workloads, or small-scale analytics then we would love to hear from you. We want you to establish yourself as a trusted industry expert, able to help developers solve the difficulties they face with Timescale products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Timescale is a developer-first company. There will never be confusion in this role about whether or not we’re a developer company. We are, and we embrace it. You’ll also work in an organization where even the marketing people write code. We love developers, and you’ll fit right in if you love developers, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Timescale is a mostly remote company with team members around the world, and English language fluency is a requirement. The preferred candidate for this role will have working hours in United States time zones to better coordinate with their teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create content, videos, and samples from beginner to best practices that demonstrate how to develop and work with Timescale, Postgres, and time-series data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create benchmarking content that zooms out to focus on the big picture, comparing more than just raw performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify external advocates and community leaders, and support them as they talk about Timescale and time-series data independent of us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect and summarize customer feedback and relay it effectively to the product team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use data, experiments, and customer feedback to drive Timescale adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent written communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent presentation creation and delivery skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A self-starter who can manage and prioritize initiatives that will make developers successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to quantify and meet project goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with PostgreSQL is strongly preferred; it’s the backbone of our product, and we need you to be able to dive deep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industry experience with the type of data you’d use Timescale with. This could be anything, but be prepared to cover it in your interview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous experience working with developers is highly desirable, but that could be as an advocate, an evangelist, a developer, or a solutions architect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience working with 3rd party communities, social media, and blogging is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A deep understanding and appreciation for the constant and rapid shift in how and where people consume content and share their experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A belief that organizations and industries are best when they are diverse and inclusive, and a commitment to ensuring that everything we do reflects that belief.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works well independently and remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By applying for this position, you are agreeing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timescale.com/legal/timescale-applicant-privacy-notice&quot;&gt;Timescale&#39;s Applicant Privacy Notice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
