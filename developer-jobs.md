<div>
<strong>Lifetimely is a SaaS company looking for an experienced Ruby on Rails engineer to help build out our SaaS product serving 6000+ e-commerce stores. Our users include names like MrBeast’s snacking brand Feastables, Liquid Death, and Colgate.<br></strong><br>
</div><div>You can read about our app <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/lifetimely-lifetime-value-and-profit-analytics/">on the Shopify app store</a>. We provide real-time reporting to ecommerce shop owners. To give you a sense of scale - we collect data on millions of orders per day from thousands of ecommerce stores and process many millions of background jobs to be able to deliver quality reporting and insights to our customers.<br><br>
</div><div>We're looking to add a great backend RoR developer to our existing team.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>We are looking for someone who</strong>:<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>has worked on and had to support a web app in production at scale for at least 5 years</li>
<li>At least 5 years of working experience writing maintainable and well-tested Ruby on Rails apps</li>
<li>humble, can mentor others, both provide and receive direction and is always willing to share what they learn</li>
<li>overlaps with CET zone at least 5 hours ( prefer Europe )</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>What you will do:<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>extend the product to integrate with new ecommerce platforms (like Amazon)</li>
<li>build and have ownership over new integrations with external data sources we use to augment our reports (we integrate with wide range of systems from ad platforms to CRMs and shipping services.)</li>
<li>optimize our existing complex backend processing jobs</li>
<li>optimize existing data pipelines</li>
<li>participate in building new app features for thousands of merchants who trust us with their reporting data</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>Where we are and how we work:<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>We are a distributed team all over the globe but our development team is mainly working during Western European working hours.</li>
<li>We are used to async communication over Slack but also have regular weekly meetings to sync up.</li>
<li>Our tech stack is Ruby / Javascript / Stimulus / Tailwind CSS / SQL / Git</li>
<li>We optimize new features for the long term. For us, this is not a sprint but a marathon.</li>
</ul><div>Working for Lifetimely doesn't feel like the usual office or startup gig: we are a distributed group of twelve people across eight different countries with our own way of working. Some of us are nomads, some just like working remotely. We highly encourage written (long-form) communication and documenting things on Notion, and generally don't like tight fixed schedules.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>We expect you to be independent and know how to manage yourself.</strong> We prioritize shipping and results above how or when you do the work.<br><br>
</div><div>Two meetings per week, one for the devs on Tuesday, and another one on Thursday for everyone. That's it.<br><br>
</div><div>If you prefer to do meetings and calls or just know that you need a lot of human interaction, Lifetimely is probably not the best place for you to work at. But if you are into distributed work and prefer the lifestyle aspects or maybe live somewhere with not a lot of exciting product companies to work for, you will enjoy working with us.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>Compensation<br></strong><br>
</div><div>This is a full-time position with annual compensation of <strong>USD 70 000 to USD 110 000</strong> and varies with experience and skill set. You can be a full-time employee with PTO (through Multiplier) or a full-time contractor, depending on your location and preferences. We will provide you the necessary equipment and pay for a co-working space if you have one nearby.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>Hiring process<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Our process has three steps:<br><br>
</div><ol>
<li>A simple coding task that takes no more than 30 min and can be done at your convenience</li>
<li>Video call where we discuss the task and ask you about your experience</li>
<li>A paid trial two-week contract (if your current role allows) where you work with us as if you were full-time. If this is not possible, we can also do a traditional tech interview instead.</li>
</ol><div>
<strong><br>How to apply:<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Tell us about:<br><br>
</div><ol>
<li>Describe the largest web app you worked on and the most challenging problem you worked on?</li>
<li>The timezone you are in?</li>
<li>When can you start at the earliest?</li>
<li>Your salary requirements</li>
</ol><div>After you've applied, we will reach out to you for a test task if you're selected for the first round of interviews.</div>

</div><div>
<strong><br>About the team<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are a global team of 130+ awesome people working from over 40 countries around the globe.

Every few months we travel to meet up somewhere in the world and spend some quality time together.

<li>Develop and maintain scalable data visualizations using modern frontend technologies such as React and Nivo</li>
<li>Optimize frontend performance to ensure fast rendering and smooth interactions for high data volumes</li>
<li>Conduct code reviews, identify and resolve technical issues, and maintain high coding standards</li>
<li>Collaborate with other development teams to identify and implement best practices in frontend development and related areas</li>
</ul><div><strong><br>About you/Requirements</strong></div><div>
<br>We would love to hear from you if you have significant experience in frontend development and can lead major development projects. You love working with data visualizations and believe React and web components are the future.</div><div>
<br>In particular, we are looking for:</div><ul>
<li>Extensive knowledge about JavaScript and React, and preferably Redux and a side effect managing library like Redux-Saga</li>
<li>Demonstrated experience leading large development projects, with good organization skills and the ability to plan well-structured projects, estimate tasks, manage stakeholders and coordinate with other cross-functional teams</li>
<li>A knack for data visualizations, with some familiarity of its principles and best practices</li>
<li>Knowledge about testing frameworks, like Jest</li>
<li>Excellent communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work in a remote team environment</li>
<li>Strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and ability to work independently</li>
</ul><div><strong><br>Some benefits</strong></div><ul>
<li>Freedom to choose when and how much you work - we only measure results</li>
<li>24 days of paid time off a year, plus your local holidays</li>
<li>In-person meetups for team-building (expenses covered)</li>
<li>4-6 weeks paid sabbatical (depending on the tenure)</li>
<li>Laptop budget up to €2,500 and it renews every 3 years</li>
<li>€2,000 budget to set up your home office, and additional €300 every year after 3 years of tenure</li>
<li>€250 per month for co-working space membership and/or internet service at home</li>
<li>€4,000 per year contribution to use for training, workshops, and conferences</li>
<li>€2,000 per year contribution for any equipment or services to improve and/or maintain your physical and mental health</li>
<li>Support for buying tools you need for doing your best work (even eyeglasses if you need a new pair)</li>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>

<li>Creative, you can quickly produce assets using image and video editing tools.</li>

    <div class="content-conclusion"><h3>BUILD IN A WEEKEND. SCALE TO BILLIONS</h3>
<p>Supabase adds auth, realtime, and restful APIs to Postgres without a single line of code.</p>
<p>Each project within Supabase is an isolated&nbsp;Postgres cluster, allowing customers to scale independently, while still providing the features that you need to build: instant database setup, auth, row level security, realtime data streams, auto-generating APIs, and a simple to use web interface.</p>
<p>We are a fully remote company.</p>
<p>Key Tech: Javascript, Typescript, Go, Elixir, PostgREST (haskell), Postgres, Pulumi.</p>
<h3><a id="about-the-team" class="anchor"></a>About the team</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're a startup. It's unstructured.</li>
<li>Collectively founded more than a dozen venture-backed companies.</li>
<li>More than 10 different nationalities.</li>
<li>We deeply believe in <a href="https://supabase.com/blog/2022/03/25/should-i-open-source-my-company" target="_blank">the efficacy of collaborative open source</a>. We support existing communities and tools, rather than building "yet another xx".</li>
<li>We "dogfood" everything. If you use it in your project, we use it in Supabase.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="process" class="anchor"></a>Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>The entire process is fully remote and all communication will happen over email or via video chat.</li>
<li>Once you've submitted your application, the team will review your submission, and may reach out for a short screening interview over video call.</li>
<li>If you pass the screen you will be invited to up to four follow up interviews. The calls:
<ul>
<li>usually take between 20-45 minutes each depending on the interviewer.</li>
<li>are all 1:1.</li>
<li>will be with both founders, a member of either the growth or engineering team (depending on the role), and usually one other person from your immediate team or function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the interviews are over, the team will meet to discuss several roles and candidates and may:
<ul>
<li>ask one or two follow-up questions over email or a quick call.</li>
<li>go directly to making an offer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
