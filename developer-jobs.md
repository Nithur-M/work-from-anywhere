<p>Join a team dedicated to creating products people love as a Remote Senior React Native Developer</p>
<p>We're growing and looking for an experienced Developer with significant React Native experience to join our team, and to help us to evolve our React Native offering.</p>
<p>You'll work directly with clients on projects as a Senior React Native Developer, guiding by example with your communication and advocating for how we work as consultants, especially in difficult situations. You'll partner closely with product managers, designers, developers, and clients to help solve problems.</p>
<p>You'll deliver high-quality, well-tested software, mentor both client and thoughtbot engineering teams in software best practices, and advise on product prioritization, agile process, team culture, and communication.</p>
<p>During investment time, you'll contribute to the broader tech community, thoughtbot, and yourself. The majority of thoughtbot's<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot" class="external"> open-source work</a> and<a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog" class="external"> blog content</a> is the result of investment time.</p>
<p>This is a remote position on the <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/lift-off" class="external">Lift Off</a> team, which staffs cross-functional project teams with deep expertise in new product development, that provides clients with expert product strategy, risk management, and cross-functional expertise.</p>
<p>thoughtbot is a fully remote company. Because we're looking for teammates who overlap with our clients' teams working hours, this is a remote position available to anyone throughout the Americas (UTC-3 through UTC-10).</p>
<p><strong>We will begin reviewing applications for this role no sooner than </strong><strong>September 23, 2022.</strong><br></p>
<h3><br></h3>
<h3>Salary</h3>
<p>Salary and benefits vary by location and country. You can view the compensation and benefits for where you live at <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/jobs/compensation?department=Development&amp;title=Senior+Developer" class="external">https://thoughtbot.com/jobs/compensation?department=Development&amp;title=Senior+Developer</a></p>
<h3><br></h3>
<h3>About thoughtbot</h3>
<p>We believe that it is possible to continuously learn and improve the way people work while building higher-quality products that make positive contributions to the world. We work with companies in every step of the product development and maintenance process to help identify and solve problems. We lead and participate in product design sprints, build high-quality apps, and then deploy them.</p>
<p>We proactively work on improving diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) at thoughtbot. We aim to maintain an inclusive work environment where everyone can thrive professionally, as well as have full lives outside of work. Read about our DEI efforts in the <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/playbook/our-company/diversity-equity-and-inclusion" class="external">Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</a> section of our Playbook. We acknowledge that DEI work is never done, and that we will make mistakes along the way. We are continuously working on learning, improving ourselves, and the company.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Senior React Native Developers at thoughtbot are able to build high-quality, test-driven cross-platform mobile applications using React Native and Typescript.</p>
<p>While React Native is a must, additional experience or interest in native mobile development, such as iOS with Swift or Android with Kotlin, or web development, especially with Ruby on Rails or React, is a big plus.</p>
<p>Well-qualified candidates will have in-depth experience with mobile development and related technologies, patterns, and tools. They will have knowledge of the differences in navigation and interaction design on iOS and Android, and be comfortable with managing the Google Play and Apple App Store submission and review processes.</p>
<p>As consultants, we work closely with our clients. Experience with a client-facing role like consulting, teaching, or business development is also valuable, but not required.</p>
<p>Well-qualified candidates value diversity, equity, and inclusion, and contributing to an inclusive working and learning environment.</p>
<p>We especially appreciate candidates that demonstrate commitment to valuing DEI and contributing to an inclusive working and learning environment. We also understand that not everyone has had the opportunity to commit to this work, and that's okay.</p>
<p>We encourage you to apply even if you don't match 100% of the requirements. Let us know if you need any specific accommodations during the interview process.</p>
<p><strong>thoughtbot cannot sponsor work visas at this time.</strong></p>

We also reserve at least 4 weeks per year for investing in ourselves, the company, and our community. Everything we do is predicated on having a great team and a culture of growing.

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
