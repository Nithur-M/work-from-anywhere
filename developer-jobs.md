<h1>Rails Backend Developer (Full-time, Remote)</h1><div>We‚Äôre seeking a full-time, remote Rails backend developer in Europe or on the US east coast.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><strong>About the Work</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>You‚Äôll be the <strong>sole Ruby on Rails developer</strong>.</li>
<li>You‚Äôll <strong>mostly work on the business logic</strong> of our web platform, and only occasionally work on the views (our frontend developer usually handles that part in a separate Next.js app).</li>
<li>You‚Äôll join a <strong>small product team</strong> consisting of 1 frontend developer, 1 part-time TypeScript backend developer, 3 designers, and 1 product manager.</li>
<li>You‚Äôll <strong>report directly to the founders</strong> (one of whom is technical) and periodically collaborate with people outside the product team.</li>
<li>You‚Äôll play an active role in the <strong>shaping and scoping</strong> of new features.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>About You</strong>
</div><div>
<br>You must naturally <strong>thrive working independently</strong>. Furthermore, you should be:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Impatient</strong> ‚Äî You must have an insatiable desire to constantly move things forward and take action without asking for permission.</li>
<li>
<strong>Comfortable in uncertainty</strong> ‚Äî You must regularly dive into complex problems and systems without knowing all of their details upfront.</li>
<li>
<strong>Something to prove</strong> ‚Äî A desire to show the world what you‚Äôre made of; ambition matters.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Our Development Principles</strong><br><br>
</div><div>The following principles have served us well; you should at least be open to them:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Get to production</strong> ‚Äî We want to get things into their real environment as early as possible and then rapidly iterate from there. This means constantly shipping incremental pieces, whether it be directly to customers, behind feature flags, on an obscure URL, as a script, or some other form.</li>
<li>
<strong>Constantly fight the urge to do more</strong> ‚Äî Everyone, including yourself, will naturally slide towards wanting to make the thing a little bigger and a little better. You must be vigilant in pushing back to avoid scope creep.</li>
<li>
<strong>Testing means clicking</strong> ‚Äî Automated tests are great, but actually using the real thing, in a browser, with production data is indispensable. A feature is not tested if you haven‚Äôt tried it the way the end-user will.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>About Baymard Institute</strong>

<li>Founders engaged in the product (both are active in the product team).</li>
<li>Flexible hours.</li>
<li>Room for growth.</li>
</ul><div>
<br>See the ‚Äú<a href="https://baymard.com/jobs/web-developer#key-work-values-at-baymard">key work values</a>‚Äù section for a description of each of the above bullets.<br><br>

<p>
  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> Fully remote company (worldwide, incorporated in Berlin)
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://opencraft.com/">https://opencraft.com/</a>
</p>

<div>Do you care about contributing to open-source, and appreciate a good challenge? We do too! :)¬†<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Open-source<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are a team of veteran open-source developers, working on educational and community-based projects in an<a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/open_first/"> open-first</a> environment ‚Äì and we are looking for new members. By joining us, you will work full-time on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums.¬†</div><div>
<br>We care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.</div><div>
<br><strong>Remote-first</strong>
</div><div>
<br>Unlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it‚Äôs none of our business when or where you work from. :)</div><div>
<br>We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!). We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good documentation practices.</div><div>
<br><strong>Online education<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are one of the main contributors to the <a href="https://open.edx.org/">Open edX project</a>, the main open-source MOOC platform created by MIT, Harvard and many other top universities. It powers sites like <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, the <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library">MIT Open Learning Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fun-mooc.fr/">national online learning platform for France</a>. We provide development and hosting for institutions like <a href="https://onlinelearning.hms.harvard.edu/hmx/">Harvard Medical School</a>, <a href="https://www.labxchange.org">Harvard LabXchange</a>, <a href="https://ondemand.cloudera.com">Cloudera</a>, <a href="https://www.upskill.autodesk.com">Autodesk</a>, and several governments. We are not affiliated with <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, but we contribute and work with them on various projects.¬†</div><div>
<br><strong>Technical stack</strong><br><br>
</div><div>The Open edX project is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. Tasks are varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working full-stack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Contracting terms<br></strong><br>
</div><div>This is a full-time, permanent contract position. We aim for long-term relationships -- once in, almost all team members stay for many years.¬†</div><div><br></div><div>We care about paying fairly:¬†</div><ul>
<li>Team members set their own compensation level, which is paid based on hours worked (no unpaid overtime!).¬†</li>
<li>When determining your rate, we will expect you to factor in benefits (vacation, healthcare, purchase budgets, etc.) - the idea is to let <em>you</em> pick the benefits that are useful to you, rather than offer one-size-fits-all packages that aren‚Äôt always very valuable.</li>
<li>We also proactively apply generous raises team-wide, based on the company results at the end of each year. <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/team_compensation/">See the details about how we approach compensation in our handbook</a>.</li>
</ul><div>We also firmly believe in work-life balance: as long as you deliver what you commit to, there is a lot of latitude in how much work you can choose to accept. We are open to time commitments anywhere in the 30h to 40h/week range, and highly discourage working more than that. It‚Äôs important to have time to ourselves, as well as having some slack, and there are diminishing returns in working more anyway. We are currently recruiting precisely to preserve that balance, and ensure we have plenty of capacity to handle our projects.</div><div><br></div><div>We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.</div><div>
<br><strong>Basic Requirements:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Experience with contributing to free software projects - small contributions are completely fine, but you <em>must</em> have at least one patch or pull request merged in a third-party project, or been a maintainer of an open source project with significant adoption. (Note that you can contribute now to satisfy this requirement - see for example the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/build-test-release-wg/projects/1">Open edX release issues</a>, fixing one of these issues guarantees an interview.)</li>
<li>Senior developer with 3+ years working with Python</li>
<li>Experience with Python web frameworks, specifically Django</li>
<li>3+ years of HTML, Javascript, and CSS (experience with React and/or Typescript is a big plus!)</li>
<li>Experience with unit testing</li>
<li>Comfortable working in a Linux environment, specifically Debian or Ubuntu</li>
<li>Experience with databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Additional Skills:</strong><br><br>
</div><div>You will work on tasks from the following categories, but you can pick up the skills on the job if you haven't mastered these yet:</div><ul>
<li>DevOps experience, especially on Debian/Ubuntu servers, Terraform, Vault, Packer, Prometheus, ELK, Docker. We are building a modern infrastructure and having a strong DevOps presence on top of core software engineering skills is a big plus with us.</li>
<li>Cloud computing, like AWS or OpenStack</li>
<li>Configuration management tools such as Ansible, Consul</li>
<li>RabbitMQ, Redis &amp; Elasticsearch</li>
<li>Mobile development (iOS and/or Android)</li>
<li>Managing clients &amp; projects from beginning to completion (senior developer)</li>
<li>Public speaking at conferences (you would present a talk every year at the Open edX Con)</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Apply for this Position</strong><br><br>
</div><div>Our recruitment process differs from most other companies - we don‚Äôt believe resumes and the traditional interviews to be particularly effective. Often, they tell more about how good someone is at interviewing, rather than at the actual work. So, our initial interview is lighter and easier to pass than in other companies - but we then provide you with real (and paid!) work to see how it works out in reality.</div><ul>
<li>Step 1: You apply by filling out this form: <a href="https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/">https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/</a>¬†</li>
<li>Step 2: We do two interviews with candidates matching the requirements listed above. The first interview includes a (simple) coding exercise.</li>
<li>Step 3: If this works out, we hire you! We start with a 2 months <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/processes/#recruitment">trial period</a>, which allows both you and the rest of the team to fully evaluate how we work together, and is followed by a final review and confirmation.¬†</li>

It may be wrong to call these ‚ÄúChats‚Äù, because they‚Äôre more like curated feeds. We‚Äôre building a tool for users to create, manage, and view theirs and other‚Äôs curations.¬†</span></p>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A¬∑Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing.¬†</p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A¬∑Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A¬∑Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A¬∑Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="">
<li style=""><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A¬∑Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.¬†</li>
<li style=""><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A¬∑Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.¬†</span></p>
