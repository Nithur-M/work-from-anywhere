                <h1>About Clerk</h1><p style="min-height:1.5em">We build developer tools for authentication. We're known for our React components like <code>&lt;SignIn/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;UserProfile /&gt;</code> that "just work" when they're added to the page.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Our components are powered by a new type of API: a frontend-facing API that relies on session tokens for authorization, instead of a backend-facing API that relies on a secret key. We've found this pattern unlocks a new level of efficiency. Developers can implement Clerk faster than traditional APIs because it comes built-in with UX and UI. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">To learn more about the approach, see our talk on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4">A Component is Worth a Thousand APIs</a>.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h1>About the Role</h1><p style="min-height:1.5em">We're seeking a Developer Success Engineer to join our team, working at the intersection of technical problem-solving and developer experience.
