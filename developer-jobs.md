                About the company

Meilisearchâs mission is to create a best-in-class search experience for every website and application. We are building a blazingly fast and ultra-relevant search engine made in Rust that allows our partners to have a powerful search engine without initial configuration. Features such as typo-tolerance, filters, and synonyms are provided out-of-the-box.

We are fully open source: we strongly believe the best way to realize our vision is to leverage the open source community's power. We already have many integrations and SDKs to allow any developer to try Meilisearch in their environment quickly. We have a vibrant connection with our community of early adopters and builders. We are in contact every day and eagerly listen to feedback from our contributors.

We completed a $5 million round of funding September 2021, and are backed by 5 leading international investors: CRV,Mango Capital,LocalGlobe, Seedcamp, and Kima Ventures. We have already partnered with industry heavyweights like Louis Vuitton and Platform.sh.

We are a team of 26 passionate people, and our project is growing fast (+10K GitHub stars in 12 months). To raise awareness around Meilisearch and deliver the best possible experience to our community, we are looking for a Developer Advocate.

About the Developer Relations Team

The team is composed today of Ferdinand, Carolina, Oluwaseyi and Luna.

Their overall responsibility is to ensure the projects of the company are widely known and used by developers, as well as to foster and nurture a welcoming open-source community that encourages developer success.

An important part of their mission is to be the bridge between our users and all relevant teams at Meilisearch; they provide feedback from our users to teams internally, and make sure theyâre addressed, as well as keep our users updated about evolutions and future projects.

What you'll be doing

As a Developer Advocate, you role is to bring support and to be an inspiration for developers who want to use Meilisearch. You will create and distribute educational technical content for our users, and ensure the feedback of the community is addressed by our teams internally. You will also take part in empowering technical teams to become more visible.Â 

Your role will include:

ð Creating technical material to help users understand and realize the value of Meilisearch:
- Enabling user success by building and/or communicating about relevant tools or code projects,
- Building attractive search experience demos,
- Writing efficient tutorials that help users get started and relate to their use case.

ð Representing Meilisearch at events:
- Identifying relevant events for Meilisearch and organizing our participation (meetups, conferences, hackathons, workshops, etc.),
- Participating in these events as a speaker, mentor, or sponsor,

ð Being an internal advocate for Developer Relations
- Educating other teams at Meilisearch about DevRel best practices,
- Supporting and coordinating actions taken towards technical visibility outside of the DevRel team.

As part of the Developer Relations team, your role will also include:

ð Listening to users and the broader community, understanding pain points and opportunities, and delivering feedback to the engineering and product teams to improve the developer experience
ð Keeping yourself and your team up to date regarding best practices in Developer Relations: industry trends, content creation, event organization, communication with the community...

Our ideal profile
Our ideal profile identifies as a teacher & a learner, a builder and a doer, a mentor and a communicator. Your fit with our team is as important to us as your technical background, if not more so.

- Stock options,
- We are open to fully remote applications, as long as you are between GMT-4 and GMT+5 time zones,

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </span></p>

Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </span></p>
