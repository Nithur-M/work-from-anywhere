<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our mission</strong></p>

<p><strong>About the team</strong></p>
<p>We're looking for a <strong>Senior</strong> <strong>backend developer</strong> to join our cross-functional <strong>app team</strong>. You’ll build the backend to help us create a world where creating software is as easy and accessible as describing what you want and sharing your work is as simple as clicking a button.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">You’ll use <strong>TypeScript</strong> to design, build, and ship a <strong>completely new</strong> user-facing product in collaboration with product managers, designers, and developers.</li>
<li style="">You’ll develop scalable backend infrastructure with <strong>Bun</strong>, <strong>Node.js,</strong> and <strong>K8s</strong>.</li>
<li style="">You’ll build and operate <strong>APIs and infrastructure</strong>, taking operational ownership of the services.</li>

<li style=""><strong>You're framework-agnostic. </strong>You’re open to getting familiar with <strong>C# and .NET</strong> for parts of our backend stack.</li>
<li style=""><strong>You have a bias for action.</strong> You have a strong sense of urgency; when you see a problem, you solve it. You don't have time to waste on analysis paralysis and prefer to learn from your mistakes as you go.</li>
<li style=""><strong>You’re excited about AI and its potential.</strong> You’re deeply curious about AI and AI tooling and eager to explore how they can unlock new possibilities and make a real impact.</li>
<li style=""><strong>You’ve built and maintained APIs.</strong> You hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems, bringing a sound understanding of API design and best practices.</li>

<li style=""><strong>You ooze the values of the DevOps mindset.</strong> You’re intensely curious and passionate about running software in DevOps environments and eager to explore DevOps and SRE more.</li>
<li style=""><strong>You know a thing or two about architecture, containerization, and orchestration.</strong> You’re keen to learn/or use container systems like Docker, Kubernetes, and/or Platform as a Service.</li>
<li style=""><strong>You bring a strong sense of ownership</strong>. You believe in solving a problem entirely rather than simply shipping a solution. You operate autonomously and follow through on your commitments.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How we work</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">We ask you to be in the time zone UTC ±0 to UTC +2 for this role.</li>
<li style="">If you’re located outside this time zone range and want to move to the company’s official headquarters in Austria, we’ll handle the <strong>work permit process</strong> and cover travel expenses.</li>
<li style="">If you prefer to work outside your home, we offer a physical location in Vienna and <strong>co-working stipends</strong> in other cities.</li>
<li style="">We love <strong>working async.</strong> You can set your own pace and schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our global perks and benefits</strong></p>

<li style="">The chance to build a world-class product, positively impact millions of aspiring developers, and be a virtual owner of the company with <strong>equity</strong> (phantom stock).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our 4-step hiring process, in a nutshell</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">You’ll first have a video call with a member of the People team for a <strong>quick get-to-know chat.</strong></li>
<li style="">Then, <strong>you’ll be given a take-home challenge</strong> to work on. Don’t worry; we know you have many things on your plate and good things take time. You won’t be given a deadline.</li>
<li style="">Next <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">is the <strong>technical interview</strong> to show </span>your skills to the hiring manager.</li>
<li style="">Lastly, you’ll meet your <strong>potential future peers</strong> for a laid-back conversation.</li>
<li style="">If everything goes smoothly, you’ll receive an <strong>offer</strong> from us shortly after. Fingers crossed!</li>

                &lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who we are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating developers &lt;/strong&gt;with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🌎 The ideal candidate for this role will reside in San Francisco, California. Regular attendance at weekly Developer and AI events in the city is an essential aspect of this position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Required locations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;San Francisco, California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not subscribe to “I do my best work when I work 40 hours a week.” &amp;nbsp;People we hire at Sourcegraph believe that building outstanding things means working very hard — smarter and more hours than the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this job is exciting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Developer Advocate at Sourcegraph, you will be a champion for how developers understand and navigate complex codebases using our platform. You&#39;ll be connecting with the developer community and sharing the value of our AI Code Assistant and Code Search platform through written, video, and live engagements. You&#39;ll be part of a small but impactful team, representing Sourcegraph and its commitment to improving the developer experience. You&#39;ll have the opportunity to help developers at the most successful and sophisticated companies in the world (our customers) implement and scale code AI capabilities. We&#39;re looking for someone passionate about driving adoption and empowering engineers through creative story telling and genuine community building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Developer Advocate, you will spend 25% of your time engaging with Developers at events in-person and 75% of your time creating content and recording videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attend and host 2-5 meet-ups and events in San Francisco monthly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Represent our user community within Sourcegraph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build apps with Sourcegraph in public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build integrations on top of Sourcegraph (such as teaching Sourcegraph how to use and gather information from other dev tools, including logging, perf, etc., tools)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Livestream and record demos of what you build, for Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an incredibly helpful and inspirational member of our dev community yourself and help grow it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write awesome technical blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote Sourcegraph on social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help connect our user community growth to our product-led growth engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall, help define what dev advocacy means at Sourcegraph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills and experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

<p>We are hiring a Developer Advocate Intern to support our Developer Relations team, focusing on creating, editing, and repurposing technical content.</p>

You'll also be responsible for repurposing existing content from the team into engaging short-form videos, blog posts, and social media clips to maximize reach and impact.</p>
<p>You’ll work closely with both our engineering, growth, and product teams to ensure content is technically accurate and optimized for multiple platforms. If you’re a developer who enjoys working behind the scenes to amplify technical content and turn one great piece into many - this role is for you.</p>

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are hiring a Junior developer with a proven track record in Python and/or Go. As part of the Observability team, you will develop a cloud-native monitoring stack that composes best-in-class open-source monitoring tools. The stack is opinionated, resilient, and scalable, providing deep insights out of the box. The user experience is polished and seamless for the end-users, and its administrators will enjoy smooth, lightweight Day 1 and Day 2 operations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Build a rewarding, meaningful career working with the best and brightest people in technology at Canonical, the growing international software company behind Ubuntu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The monitoring stack will monitor applications running on a mix of cloud technologies such as Kubernetes and OpenStack, as well as bare-metal, virtual machines and containers. The stack will be capable of monitoring applications and infrastructure irrespective of whether they are operated by Juju, and will leverage multiple data sources at various levels of the architecture, including Juju itself, to contextualize the collected telemetry and insights delivered to the end-users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You will work with the product designer and marketing team to bridge the gap between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides and defining how the application looks and works. The primary focus will be on publicly-faced websites. Still, the person will contribute to internal back office UIs, building easy-to-use interfaces for internal teams in ever-evolving architecture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop new user-facing features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build reusable code and libraries for future use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure the technical feasibility of design from a visual and experience standpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize application for maximum speed and scalability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure consistency of data gathered from the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with other team members and stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing internal tooling UI and platform for non-web-native team members to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize the website, SEO, and contribute to CMS integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills needed:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great understanding of the newest trends, best practices and standards in web development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in leading the development of medium to large-scale projects, focusing on UX and Security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of server-side CSS pre-processing platforms&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient understanding of client-side scripting, security best practices, and browser performance optimizations&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great knowledge of advanced JavaScript libraries and frameworks, such as AngularJS, ReactJS, Next (at least one of them), etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good understanding of asynchronous request handling, partial page updates, SPA, SSG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good knowledge of tools necessary for autonomous delivery (image processing, building, etc)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with tools such as Figma and Lokalise is a plus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient understanding of cross-browser compatibility issues and ways to work around them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient understanding of code versioning tools, such as GitHub.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good knowledge of SEO principles and ensuring that applications will adhere to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent attention to detail with a high level of ownership mentality to deliver results independently and iteratively.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other requirements&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dedicated workspace.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Devices and other essential equipment that meet minimal technical specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alignment with Our Values and the Xapo Values-Driven Leadership principles.&lt;/li&gt;

No. We’re actually looking for an <em>engineer</em>*. A rare type of engineer that cares about talking to and advocating for customers, helping unblock them by fixing bugs or writing up sample code, and providing customers with guidance, pointers and support. We say <em>rare</em> because in our experience, most engineers aspire to architect large-scale systems or tackle deeply technical problems. Said differently, most engineers want to have influence over the <em>technology</em> they work on or with. There’s nothing wrong with that, we love hardcore engineers. There are many at LiveKit — we’re not complaining. But, this time, we’re looking for a new teammate that wants to have influence over our <em>product</em> and <em>business</em>.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers.

Additionally, you will play a key role in maintaining and improving our open-source ecosystem, including a wide range of Server API SDKs, frontend libraries, and mobile libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your code will be executed millions of times daily, ensuring accurate device intelligence and seamless protection for our customers’ most sensitive workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Implement API-based and edge-based security logic, ensuring seamless communication between Fingerprint, cloud services, and customers’ infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain and improve our open-source ecosystem, including Server API SDKs, frontend libraries, and mobile libraries to ensure seamless developer adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with SDKs and open-source projects that enable customers to integrate Fingerprint’s device intelligence into their workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with product managers, engineers, and designers to improve customer experience and technical performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write internal and public documentation to guide customers in integrating Fingerprint with third-party cloud platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-5 years of experience with at least a subset of the following technologies: JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Go, Java.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-3 years of experience working with Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda, or similar edge computing platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience integrating third-party services and APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on customer-facing products, such as dashboards, SDKs, or developer tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with SDK and library development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work asynchronously in a remote-based team, with excellent communication skills and attention to detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep interest in cloud platforms, open-source development, and developer experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To demonstrate your attention to detail, please include the current major version of the Fingerprint Pro Server Python SDK into the box below&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Contributions to open-source projects or published technical content related to integrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in technical writing for API and integration documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for someone passionate about customer-facing integrations, cloud security, edge computing, and developer experience, while also maintaining and improving our open-source ecosystem and existing integrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with the Best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are Orderly, the ultimate destination for decentralized trading platforms. We are not satisfied with the limitations of centralized exchanges or the complexities of building decentralized order books. We aim to make trading easy, fast, and secure for everyone. How? By fusing the simplicity of CeFi with the power of DeFi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of the issue lies “liquidity”. Builders often grapple with a paradox; traders need liquidity, but liquidity demands traders. Our solution is simple as is bold –&lt;span class=&quot;text-primary-100 font-semibold&quot;&gt;concentrate all liquidity into one order book. One order book that connects all the liquidity in the crypto space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our ambition doesn&#39;t stop there. We&#39;re omnichain, championing chain abstraction. We envision seamless transactions, where the underlying blockchain is merely a detail. By concentrating liquidity, we aim to redefine the crypto landscape, making bridging and wrapped assets a thing of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are Orderly, and we are here to revolutionize DeFi, democratizing access to financial opportunities and fostering a fair, equitable paradigm for all.&lt;/p&gt;
