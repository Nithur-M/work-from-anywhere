&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating developers &lt;/strong&gt;with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🌎 The ideal candidate for this role will reside in San Francisco, California. Regular attendance at weekly Developer and AI events in the city is an essential aspect of this position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Required locations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;San Francisco, California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not subscribe to “I do my best work when I work 40 hours a week.” &amp;nbsp;People we hire at Sourcegraph believe that building outstanding things means working very hard — smarter and more hours than the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this job is exciting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Represent our user community within Sourcegraph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build apps with Sourcegraph in public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build integrations on top of Sourcegraph (such as teaching Sourcegraph how to use and gather information from other dev tools, including logging, perf, etc., tools)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Livestream and record demos of what you build, for Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an incredibly helpful and inspirational member of our dev community yourself and help grow it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write awesome technical blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote Sourcegraph on social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help connect our user community growth to our product-led growth engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall, help define what dev advocacy means at Sourcegraph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills and experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Any outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, you will play a key role in maintaining and improving our open-source ecosystem, including a wide range of Server API SDKs, frontend libraries, and mobile libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Implement API-based and edge-based security logic, ensuring seamless communication between Fingerprint, cloud services, and customers’ infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain and improve our open-source ecosystem, including Server API SDKs, frontend libraries, and mobile libraries to ensure seamless developer adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with SDKs and open-source projects that enable customers to integrate Fingerprint’s device intelligence into their workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with product managers, engineers, and designers to improve customer experience and technical performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write internal and public documentation to guide customers in integrating Fingerprint with third-party cloud platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-5 years of experience with at least a subset of the following technologies: JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-3 years of experience working with Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda, or similar edge computing platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience integrating third-party services and APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on customer-facing products, such as dashboards, SDKs, or developer tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with SDK and library development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work asynchronously in a remote-based team, with excellent communication skills and attention to detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep interest in cloud platforms, open-source development, and developer experience.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Contributions to open-source projects or published technical content related to integrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in technical writing for API and integration documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for someone passionate about customer-facing integrations, cloud security, edge computing, and developer experience, while also maintaining and improving our open-source ecosystem and existing integrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
