Working from Figma prototypes and pre-defined network APIs you will work within our Core Apps team to build and maintain web applications that interact with our unique mobile app, backend infrastructure to connect web and mobile experiences, and SDKs and technologies that developers will use to create their own web applications that interact with our mobile app.<strong></strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">What are we looking for?Â </h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Youâre a confident coder who likes to work at the user interface level, and you have built public-facing websites or applications in Typescript in the past.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Youâre a generalist, and have experience building REST services and/or WebSocket backends.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">You are a researcher and enjoy requirements engineering for SDK development.Â </p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">You like to actively shape designs and play with ideas as you build, and are comfortable iterating until it feels just right.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Youâre able to isolate the 90% case for user experiences.Â Â </p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">You think in terms of making the most common interactions effortless, rather than making anything possible.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Youâre intelligent and learn quickly.Â  Absolutely no one at Radix winds up only doing whatâs in their job description, and adaptability is essential.</p></li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">What do you need?</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">4+ years as a professional software engineer in full-stack development</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">You are fluent in Typescript.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">You haveÂ  SDK development experience.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">You know how to work with complex APIâs (ideally WebRTC, WebAuthn, etc)</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">You excel at researching and requirements gathering.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Youâre enthusiastic about working in a multidisciplinary team with mobile engineers.Â </p></li></ul><h1 dir="ltr">Who are we?Â </h1><p dir="ltr">At RDX Works, we're a team of like-minded thinkers who have long been convinced that we're living in the earliest stages of a global financial revolution. This revolution is being fuelled by decentralized finance (or DeFi for short), which is enabling an assortment of pioneering developers and entrepreneurs to re-invent almost every financial product that is currently traded and invested in traditional markets, without requiring central authorities or siloed infrastructure. DeFi has captured a great deal of attention and investment in the crypto-aware niche, growing assets under management from $1 billion to over $200Â  billion in a few years. Impressive as its growth has been, its current market size isn't even a rounding error on the over $400 trillion held in traditional finance. We're focused on what it will take to go from billions to trillions.</p><p dir="ltr">RDX went back to first principles to come up with the right technical solutionâthe first layer-one protocol built specifically for mainstream DeFiâand we have already tested out at over 1 million transactions per second. We're keenly aware that the need for an infinitely scalable platform is only one prerequisite among many for mass adoption, and we're also blazing new ground in the areas of purpose-built developer tools, user experiences, and regulatory integration.</p><p dir="ltr">We have forged a path deep into the future of what distributed ledger technology is going to look like and we need you to come and be part of the team that is making that happen right now.</p><p dir="ltr">If this job sounds like it was made for you, then please apply directly via the link or email errico.dipiazza@rdx.works for more information.Â Â </p><p dir="ltr">Check out our company benefits here - <a href="https://www.rdx.works/careers">RDX Works Benefits</a>Â Â </p><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, if you feel like you donât match all of the requirements, we would love you to still apply anyway. We understand that confidence gaps and imposter syndrome can get in the way of meeting incredible candidates and we wouldnât want this to prevent us from meeting you; especially as we are big advocates of helping people learn &amp; grow. This is also another reason we do not advertise salaries, we want to keep it as even a playing field as possible!Â </p><p><br /></p>

<p>
  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> Fully remote company (worldwide, incorporated in Berlin)
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://opencraft.com/">https://opencraft.com/</a>
</p>

<div>Do you care about contributing to open-source, and appreciate a good challenge? We do too! :) <br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Open-source<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are a team of veteran open-source developers, working on educational and community-based projects in an<a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/open_first/"> open-first</a> environment – and we are looking for new members. By joining us, you will work full-time on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums. </div><div>
<br>We care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.</div><div>
<br><strong>Remote-first</strong>
</div><div>
<br>Unlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it’s none of our business when or where you work from. :)</div><div>
<br>We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!). We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good documentation practices.</div><div>
<br><strong>Online education<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are one of the main contributors to the <a href="https://open.edx.org/">Open edX project</a>, the main open-source MOOC platform created by MIT, Harvard and many other top universities. It powers sites like <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, the <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library">MIT Open Learning Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fun-mooc.fr/">national online learning platform for France</a>. We provide development and hosting for institutions like <a href="https://onlinelearning.hms.harvard.edu/hmx/">Harvard Medical School</a>, <a href="https://www.labxchange.org">Harvard LabXchange</a>, <a href="https://ondemand.cloudera.com">Cloudera</a>, <a href="https://www.upskill.autodesk.com">Autodesk</a>, and several governments. We are not affiliated with <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, but we contribute and work with them on various projects. </div><div>
<br><strong>Technical stack</strong><br><br>
</div><div>The Open edX project is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. Tasks are varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working full-stack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Contracting terms<br></strong><br>
</div><div>This is a full-time, permanent contract position. We aim for long-term relationships -- once in, almost all team members stay for many years. </div><div><br></div><div>We care about paying fairly: </div><ul>
<li>Team members set their own compensation level, which is paid based on hours worked (no unpaid overtime!). </li>
<li>When determining your rate, we will expect you to factor in benefits (vacation, healthcare, purchase budgets, etc.) - the idea is to let <em>you</em> pick the benefits that are useful to you, rather than offer one-size-fits-all packages that aren’t always very valuable.</li>
<li>We also proactively apply generous raises team-wide, based on the company results at the end of each year. <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/team_compensation/">See the details about how we approach compensation in our handbook</a>.</li>
</ul><div>We also firmly believe in work-life balance: as long as you deliver what you commit to, there is a lot of latitude in how much work you can choose to accept. We are open to time commitments anywhere in the 30h to 40h/week range, and highly discourage working more than that. It’s important to have time to ourselves, as well as having some slack, and there are diminishing returns in working more anyway. We are currently recruiting precisely to preserve that balance, and ensure we have plenty of capacity to handle our projects.</div><div><br></div><div>We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.</div><div>
<br><strong>Basic Requirements:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Experience with contributing to free software projects - small contributions are completely fine, but you <em>must</em> have at least one patch or pull request merged in a third-party project, or been a maintainer of an open source project with significant adoption. (Note that you can contribute now to satisfy this requirement - see for example the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/build-test-release-wg/projects/1">Open edX release issues</a>, fixing one of these issues guarantees an interview.)</li>
<li>Senior developer with 3+ years working with Python</li>
<li>Experience with Python web frameworks, specifically Django</li>
<li>3+ years of HTML, Javascript, and CSS (experience with React and/or Typescript is a big plus!)</li>
<li>Experience with unit testing</li>
<li>Comfortable working in a Linux environment, specifically Debian or Ubuntu</li>
<li>Experience with databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Additional Skills:</strong><br><br>
</div><div>You will work on tasks from the following categories, but you can pick up the skills on the job if you haven't mastered these yet:</div><ul>
<li>DevOps experience, especially on Debian/Ubuntu servers, Terraform, Vault, Packer, Prometheus, ELK, Docker. We are building a modern infrastructure and having a strong DevOps presence on top of core software engineering skills is a big plus with us.</li>
<li>Cloud computing, like AWS or OpenStack</li>
<li>Configuration management tools such as Ansible, Consul</li>
<li>RabbitMQ, Redis &amp; Elasticsearch</li>
<li>Mobile development (iOS and/or Android)</li>
<li>Managing clients &amp; projects from beginning to completion (senior developer)</li>
<li>Public speaking at conferences (you would present a talk every year at the Open edX Con)</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Apply for this Position</strong><br><br>
</div><div>Our recruitment process differs from most other companies - we don’t believe resumes and the traditional interviews to be particularly effective. Often, they tell more about how good someone is at interviewing, rather than at the actual work. So, our initial interview is lighter and easier to pass than in other companies - but we then provide you with real (and paid!) work to see how it works out in reality.</div><ul>
<li>Step 1: You apply by filling out this form: <a href="https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/">https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/</a> </li>
<li>Step 2: We do two interviews with candidates matching the requirements listed above. The first interview includes a (simple) coding exercise.</li>
<li>Step 3: If this works out, we hire you! We start with a 2 months <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/processes/#recruitment">trial period</a>, which allows both you and the rest of the team to fully evaluate how we work together, and is followed by a final review and confirmation. </li>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>

The architecture is a multi-page application — an MVC-based, <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">modular monolith using Laravel</strong> as a back-end framework. It was started back in 2013, and since then we’ve relentlessly increased code quality, features and test coverage, and are proud to say that we have almost zero legacy code or technical debt. We believe a modular monolithic architecture can reach a <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">level of perfection</strong> where it’s <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">superior to a micro-service architecture</strong> — despite an ever-increasing number of features.</p>
