<li>Collaborate with other development teams to identify and implement best practices in frontend development and related areas</li>
</ul><div><strong><br>About you/Requirements</strong></div><div>
<br>We would love to hear from you if you have significant experience in frontend development and can lead major development projects. You love working with data visualizations and believe React and web components are the future.</div><div>
<br>In particular, we are looking for:</div><ul>
<li>Extensive knowledge about JavaScript and React, and preferably Redux and a side effect managing library like Redux-Saga</li>
<li>Demonstrated experience leading large development projects, with good organization skills and the ability to plan well-structured projects, estimate tasks, manage stakeholders and coordinate with other cross-functional teams</li>
<li>A knack for data visualizations, with some familiarity of its principles and best practices</li>
<li>Knowledge about testing frameworks, like Jest</li>
<li>Excellent communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work in a remote team environment</li>
<li>Strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and ability to work independently</li>
</ul><div><strong><br>Some benefits</strong></div><ul>
<li>Freedom to choose when and how much you work - we only measure results</li>
<li>24 days of paid time off a year, plus your local holidays</li>
<li>In-person meetups for team-building (expenses covered)</li>
<li>4-6 weeks paid sabbatical (depending on the tenure)</li>
<li>Laptop budget up to €2,500 and it renews every 3 years</li>

<p>
  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> Fully remote company (worldwide, incorporated in Berlin)
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://opencraft.com/">https://opencraft.com/</a>
</p>

<div>Do you care about contributing to open-source, and appreciate a good challenge? We do too! :) <br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Open-source<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are a team of veteran open-source developers, working on educational and community-based projects in an<a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/open_first/"> open-first</a> environment – and we are looking for new members. By joining us, you will work full-time on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums. </div><div>
<br>We care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.</div><div>
<br><strong>Remote-first</strong>
</div><div>
<br>Unlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it’s none of our business when or where you work from. :)</div><div>
<br>We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!). We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good documentation practices.</div><div>
<br><strong>Online education<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are one of the main contributors to the <a href="https://open.edx.org/">Open edX project</a>, the main open-source MOOC platform created by MIT, Harvard and many other top universities. It powers sites like <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, the <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library">MIT Open Learning Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fun-mooc.fr/">national online learning platform for France</a>. We provide development and hosting for institutions like <a href="https://onlinelearning.hms.harvard.edu/hmx/">Harvard Medical School</a>, <a href="https://www.labxchange.org">Harvard LabXchange</a>, <a href="https://ondemand.cloudera.com">Cloudera</a>, <a href="https://www.upskill.autodesk.com">Autodesk</a>, and several governments. We are not affiliated with <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, but we contribute and work with them on various projects. </div><div>
<br><strong>Technical stack</strong><br><br>
</div><div>The Open edX project is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. Tasks are varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working full-stack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Contracting terms<br></strong><br>
</div><div>This is a full-time, permanent contract position. We aim for long-term relationships -- once in, almost all team members stay for many years. </div><div><br></div><div>We care about paying fairly: </div><ul>
<li>Team members set their own compensation level, which is paid based on hours worked (no unpaid overtime!). </li>
<li>When determining your rate, we will expect you to factor in benefits (vacation, healthcare, purchase budgets, etc.) - the idea is to let <em>you</em> pick the benefits that are useful to you, rather than offer one-size-fits-all packages that aren’t always very valuable.</li>
<li>We also proactively apply generous raises team-wide, based on the company results at the end of each year. <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/team_compensation/">See the details about how we approach compensation in our handbook</a>.</li>
</ul><div>We also firmly believe in work-life balance: as long as you deliver what you commit to, there is a lot of latitude in how much work you can choose to accept. We are open to time commitments anywhere in the 30h to 40h/week range, and highly discourage working more than that. It’s important to have time to ourselves, as well as having some slack, and there are diminishing returns in working more anyway. We are currently recruiting precisely to preserve that balance, and ensure we have plenty of capacity to handle our projects.</div><div><br></div><div>We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.</div><div>
<br><strong>Basic Requirements:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Experience with contributing to free software projects - small contributions are completely fine, but you <em>must</em> have at least one patch or pull request merged in a third-party project, or been a maintainer of an open source project with significant adoption. (Note that you can contribute now to satisfy this requirement - see for example the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/build-test-release-wg/projects/1">Open edX release issues</a>, fixing one of these issues guarantees an interview.)</li>
<li>Senior developer with 3+ years working with Python</li>
<li>Experience with Python web frameworks, specifically Django</li>
<li>3+ years of HTML, Javascript, and CSS (experience with React and/or Typescript is a big plus!)</li>
<li>Experience with unit testing</li>
<li>Comfortable working in a Linux environment, specifically Debian or Ubuntu</li>
<li>Experience with databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Additional Skills:</strong><br><br>
</div><div>You will work on tasks from the following categories, but you can pick up the skills on the job if you haven't mastered these yet:</div><ul>
<li>DevOps experience, especially on Debian/Ubuntu servers, Terraform, Vault, Packer, Prometheus, ELK, Docker. We are building a modern infrastructure and having a strong DevOps presence on top of core software engineering skills is a big plus with us.</li>
<li>Cloud computing, like AWS or OpenStack</li>
<li>Configuration management tools such as Ansible, Consul</li>
<li>RabbitMQ, Redis &amp; Elasticsearch</li>
<li>Mobile development (iOS and/or Android)</li>
<li>Managing clients &amp; projects from beginning to completion (senior developer)</li>
<li>Public speaking at conferences (you would present a talk every year at the Open edX Con)</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Apply for this Position</strong><br><br>
</div><div>Our recruitment process differs from most other companies - we don’t believe resumes and the traditional interviews to be particularly effective. Often, they tell more about how good someone is at interviewing, rather than at the actual work. So, our initial interview is lighter and easier to pass than in other companies - but we then provide you with real (and paid!) work to see how it works out in reality.</div><ul>
<li>Step 1: You apply by filling out this form: <a href="https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/">https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/</a> </li>
<li>Step 2: We do two interviews with candidates matching the requirements listed above. The first interview includes a (simple) coding exercise.</li>
<li>Step 3: If this works out, we hire you! We start with a 2 months <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/processes/#recruitment">trial period</a>, which allows both you and the rest of the team to fully evaluate how we work together, and is followed by a final review and confirmation. </li>
</ul>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </span></p>

Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </span></p>

<li>Creative, you can quickly produce assets using image and video editing tools.</li>

    <div class="content-conclusion"><h3>BUILD IN A WEEKEND. SCALE TO BILLIONS</h3>
<p>Supabase adds auth, realtime, and restful APIs to Postgres without a single line of code.</p>
<p>Each project within Supabase is an isolated&nbsp;Postgres cluster, allowing customers to scale independently, while still providing the features that you need to build: instant database setup, auth, row level security, realtime data streams, auto-generating APIs, and a simple to use web interface.</p>
<p>We are a fully remote company.</p>
<p>Key Tech: Javascript, Typescript, Go, Elixir, PostgREST (haskell), Postgres, Pulumi.</p>
<h3><a id="about-the-team" class="anchor"></a>About the team</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're a startup. It's unstructured.</li>
<li>Collectively founded more than a dozen venture-backed companies.</li>
<li>More than 10 different nationalities.</li>
<li>We deeply believe in <a href="https://supabase.com/blog/2022/03/25/should-i-open-source-my-company" target="_blank">the efficacy of collaborative open source</a>. We support existing communities and tools, rather than building "yet another xx".</li>
<li>We "dogfood" everything. If you use it in your project, we use it in Supabase.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="process" class="anchor"></a>Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>The entire process is fully remote and all communication will happen over email or via video chat.</li>
<li>Once you've submitted your application, the team will review your submission, and may reach out for a short screening interview over video call.</li>
<li>If you pass the screen you will be invited to up to four follow up interviews. The calls:
<ul>
<li>usually take between 20-45 minutes each depending on the interviewer.</li>
<li>are all 1:1.</li>
<li>will be with both founders, a member of either the growth or engineering team (depending on the role), and usually one other person from your immediate team or function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the interviews are over, the team will meet to discuss several roles and candidates and may:
<ul>
<li>ask one or two follow-up questions over email or a quick call.</li>
<li>go directly to making an offer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
