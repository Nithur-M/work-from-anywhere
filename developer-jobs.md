                <p></p><p>At Cryptohopper we're looking for an AndroidÃÂ Native Developer to join our team.</p><br><p><b>You probably think cryptocurrency trading bots are like the current housing market. A black hole for many, a goldmine for few. However, these bots should be leveraged by a lot more people, because, well, they frigging work wonders. ;-) While the early adopters have been mining cryptos since the beginning. HODLING their investments for the big win. You might still be HOLDING on to your traditional savings, thinking the crypto-ship has sailedÃ¢â¬Â¦</b></p><p><b>But hey ho, hell no. There is crypto-hope on the horizon. And we invite you to embark on our mission to simplify and clarify our Ã¢â¬ËmysteriousÃ¢â¬â¢ product. To all. Including yourself, your friends, (grand)parents and that nerdy nephew who keeps pestering you with terms like FOMO, FUD and Satoshi. Take those shitcoins and run, kiddo!</b>ÃÂ </p><br><h1>Forecast: raining FOMO</h1><p>Do you ever trust the weatherman? Neither do we. But we do trust the unbeatable experts on our Cryptohopper team. And they predicted FOMO season is coming. Of course you may think this is a far-fetched prophecy. But weÃ¢â¬â¢ve been back-testing our gut feeling since the early days and we were rarely wrong. So. Buckle up. We prepare for storm.<br></p><br><h1>Android App Developer?</h1><p>Turn right if you want to develop an edge-of-your-seat app that creates an awesome experience for our traders. Prepare to snuggle up (currently not too closely) to our product teams, so you can build (and run, and love) the exact app our users need to trade on cryptocurrency markets. To succeed, you have to be versed in Kotlin and Java, and willing to get up close and personal with up-and-coming tooling. Including tech that you introduce to the stack. This is the perfect position if you combine Ã¢â¬ËhardcoreÃ¢â¬â¢ coding skills with a Ã¢â¬Ësecurity firstÃ¢â¬â¢ mindset and are excited to learn about crypto trading and blockchain technologies<br></p><br><h1>Hi, we're the stack.</h1><p>Kotlin and Java, JUnit, Truth,ÃÂ RESTful APIs, Git, Bitrise.</p><br><h1>You know you got this if.<br>
</h1><ul>
<li>You have 3+ years of experience as an Android Native app developer</li>
<li><p>You dream about Kotlin, Java, Android's design principles and application interface guidelines</p></li>
<li><p>Your lunch break experiments sometimes get out of hand. One time you accidentally developed an app that correlated caffeine intake with sock funkiness. And it worked<br></p></li>
<li><p>You have knowledge of automation and testing methodologies used for automated testing (JUnit, Truth), familiar with RESTful API's, offline storage, threading and perfomance tuningÃÂ </p></li>
<li><p>Proficient in code versioning tools such as Git and familiair withÃÂ push notifications, APIs, and cloud messaging</p></li>
<li><p>Experience with continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) solutions such as Bitrise</p></li>
                </ul><br><h1>What we offer.</h1><p>A mission-driven culture with a great work/life balance and a good benefits package. Sure, we work hard to get sh*t done, but we also regularly push our moustache (sorry, itÃ¢â¬â¢s a silly joke for Dutch readers) for a VR gaming session, picnics in the park, indoor bouldering, drinks at the pub, live DJ sessions and whatever happens in our (wo)man cave - and probably best stays there. The setting aside, we also:</p><ul>
<li>Pay you (pinky promise!): between EUR 55K and 75K per year [skill dependent]</li>
<li>Allow you to work wherever, including 2 days at our Amsterdam HQ </li>
<li>Send you on your merry way for 25 days each year, minimum (more is negotiable)</li>
<li>Provide you with great gear; a high-end laptop and whatever else you need to succeed. Perhaps an AI-driven desk chair that *knows* when you want to lean back?</li>
<li>Lifetime Cryptohopper subscription (if you donÃ¢â¬â¢t break our BFF vows)</li>
<li>Shower you with extras, like trading benefits, a generous training budget, and (mom will be proud!) the opportunity to work in a domain that accelerates financial inclusion for the unbanked</li>
<li>Pour you a stiff drink on Fridays, coffee that wonÃ¢â¬â¢t make you wish you chose tea, and lots of mind-blowing feedback on your work, hobbyÃ¢â¬â¢s, and pets. And we sincerely look forward to hearing whatÃ¢â¬â¢s on your mind, too.</li>
</ul><br><p></p><h1>Ready to virtually meet our engineers?</h1><p>We donÃ¢â¬â¢t require (in fact, please donÃ¢â¬â¢t) a motivation letter; weÃ¢â¬â¢d rather have a good chat and tell you everything you want to know. About life, the universe, and everything! Mail your resume to hr@cryptohopper.com. More information?

<li>
<strong>We’re here to enable you.</strong> It’s your work and your career. Our management team is here to help you become who you want to be, not to micromanage you.</li>
<li>
<strong>We value your ideas</strong>. At Vidalytics, our doors are always open. Need help? Come on in. Have a vision for the future of the company? We’d love to hear it. </li>

<strong>Rest and relaxation</strong>. Employees enjoy a generous PTO package.</li>

</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Vidalytics’ Values </strong></div><div><strong>(Yes, We’re Actually Serious About These) 😇</strong></div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>1 -</strong> <strong>Meritocracy</strong> – we’re building a Meritocracy, where the best ideas win -- not based on who has the bigger title. The following values underpin this. You should embody these traits. </div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>2 -</strong> <strong>Direct &amp; honest communication (transparency)</strong> – to be successful we have to face the truth and be honest. And that starts with each other. That means we give direct feedback. We want it in exchange. So feel free to argue your points, just be ready to get on board with decisions once they are made. </div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>3 -</strong> <strong>Ownership &amp; Accountability</strong> – the best people are the ones who OWN their position, tasks and even things that go beyond their ‘day-to-day responsibilities’. They never say, “that’s not my job.” Instead, they proactively spot problems and always try to think like the owner of the business. </div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>4 - Intelligence and smarts</strong> – we prize smart people. Who doesn’t? But it's not just book smarts but “business smarts” where you’re able to solve problems. Think for yourself. And don't be intimidated by any problem, no matter how complex. (Aka growth mindset). </div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>5 - Self-aware (personal growth)</strong> – we want people who can look at themselves objectively, admit their mistakes and be open to growth. When you bring this attitude to your profession, it becomes a place of personal development and self-actualization. </div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>6 - Integrity</strong> – trust is the glue that holds us together. We need to be able to trust you whether it is regarding the quality of your hours, the deadlines you set for yourself or anything else. </div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>7- Urgency </strong>– we’re a startup and you need to be able to meet deadlines. We need someone who pushes themselves when they need to and hits deadlines. And also knows how to prioritize the important things. </div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>8 - Hardworking</strong> – we’re trying to get shit done on a budget. If you’re looking for an easy job, go elsewhere. Instead, this job will constantly have challenges and opportunities to learn and grow professionally. But we try to have fun while we’re doing it and consider each other friends. </div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>9 - Data</strong> – whenever possible, we want to make decisions based on data, not emotions or opinions. </div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>10 - No assholes</strong> – Doesn’t matter how good someone is at their job, if they are going to make life suck for other people on the team, then they aren’t welcomed at Vidalytics.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>To Apply: </strong></div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>Please fill out your information here. It will come straight to us and we will be in touch right away! :) </div><div>

<p>(Fully remote, 50%+ overlap with UK working hours required)</p>
<p>DebugBear is looking for an experienced JavaScript developer.<br></p>
<p><strong><strong>What we do</strong></strong></p>
<p>DebugBear is a site speed testing and monitoring service. We help companies make their websites load faster and improve their Google Core Web Vitals metrics.<br></p> <p>We're a small business and you will be working directly with the technical founder. In this role you get to have an impact on all aspects of the product.</p> <p><strong>The role</strong></p> <p>As a full stack developer you will:</p>
<ul> <li>Implement and maintain product features while keeping in mind user experience, implementation costs, and maintainability</li> <li>Make the product scale to a larger number of users</li> <li>Ensure the product is reliable and secure</li> </ul> <p>Working in an early-stage company, you need to be able to take on a variety of tasks and complete them successfully, sometimes in the absence of established processes. You need to be mindful of customer needs to understand and challenge requirements.</p> <p><strong>Working at DebugBear</strong></p> <p>We value building a stable product that doesn't break unexpectedly, especially not outside work hours. For example, that means working with proven technologies where possible and writing automated tests.</p> <p>While there is some flexibility with work hours, this is not an asynchronous role and we expect fairly consistent work hours. Frequent communication is expected.</p> <p>Collaboration is mostly through Slack and GitHub, but this might change in the future as needed.</p> <p><strong>Tech stack</strong></p> <p>Here are some of the technologies we use:</p>
<ul> <li>TypeScript</li> <li>React</li> <li>Express</li> <li>Postgres</li> <li>Google Cloud</li> <li>Jest, Puppeteer</li> <li>Sass CSS</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Application process</strong></p>
<ol> <li>Introductory call discussing the role and your experience</li> <li>Technical interview</li> <li>An additional call as needed to discuss details</li> <li>Reference checks</li> <li>Offer</li> </ol> <p><strong>Have questions?</strong></p> <p>Email matt@debugbear.com if you have questions about the role.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p>You will need at least 3 years of commercial development experience, including significant experience with:</p>
<ul> <li>Node</li> <li>JavaScript</li> <li>React</li> <li>HTML/CSS</li> <li>Relational databases (e.g. Postgres/MySQL)</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Bonus points</strong></p>
<p>We also value experience with the following:</p>
<ul> <li>TypeScript</li> <li>Web performance optimization</li> <li>Building SaaS products</li> <li>Building developer tools<br> </li> <li>Working for a small business</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul> <li>Fully remote</li> <li>Budget: $4,000 to $6,000 per month</li> <li>28 days off a year</li> </ul>

<p>
  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> Fully remote company (worldwide, incorporated in Berlin)
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://opencraft.com/">https://opencraft.com/</a>
</p>

<div>Do you care about contributing to open-source, and appreciate a good challenge? We do too! :) <br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Open-source<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are a team of veteran open-source developers, working on educational and community-based projects in an<a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/open_first/"> open-first</a> environment – and we are looking for new members. By joining us, you will work full-time on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums. </div><div>
<br>We care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.</div><div>
<br><strong>Remote-first</strong>
</div><div>
<br>Unlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it’s none of our business when or where you work from. :)</div><div>
<br>We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!). We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good documentation practices.</div><div>
<br><strong>Online education<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are one of the main contributors to the <a href="https://open.edx.org/">Open edX project</a>, the main open-source MOOC platform created by MIT, Harvard and many other top universities. It powers sites like <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, the <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library">MIT Open Learning Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fun-mooc.fr/">national online learning platform for France</a>. We provide development and hosting for institutions like <a href="https://onlinelearning.hms.harvard.edu/hmx/">Harvard Medical School</a>, <a href="https://www.labxchange.org">Harvard LabXchange</a>, <a href="https://ondemand.cloudera.com">Cloudera</a>, <a href="https://www.upskill.autodesk.com">Autodesk</a>, and several governments. We are not affiliated with <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, but we contribute and work with them on various projects. </div><div>
<br><strong>Technical stack</strong><br><br>
</div><div>The Open edX project is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. Tasks are varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working full-stack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Contracting terms<br></strong><br>
</div><div>This is a full-time, permanent contract position. We aim for long-term relationships -- once in, almost all team members stay for many years. </div><div><br></div><div>We care about paying fairly: </div><ul>
<li>Team members set their own compensation level, which is paid based on hours worked (no unpaid overtime!). </li>
<li>When determining your rate, we will expect you to factor in benefits (vacation, healthcare, purchase budgets, etc.) - the idea is to let <em>you</em> pick the benefits that are useful to you, rather than offer one-size-fits-all packages that aren’t always very valuable.</li>
<li>We also proactively apply generous raises team-wide, based on the company results at the end of each year. <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/team_compensation/">See the details about how we approach compensation in our handbook</a>.</li>
</ul><div>We also firmly believe in work-life balance: as long as you deliver what you commit to, there is a lot of latitude in how much work you can choose to accept. We are open to time commitments anywhere in the 30h to 40h/week range, and highly discourage working more than that. It’s important to have time to ourselves, as well as having some slack, and there are diminishing returns in working more anyway. We are currently recruiting precisely to preserve that balance, and ensure we have plenty of capacity to handle our projects.</div><div><br></div><div>We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.</div><div>
<br><strong>Basic Requirements:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Experience with contributing to free software projects - small contributions are completely fine, but you <em>must</em> have at least one patch or pull request merged in a third-party project, or been a maintainer of an open source project with significant adoption. (Note that you can contribute now to satisfy this requirement - see for example the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/build-test-release-wg/projects/1">Open edX release issues</a>, fixing one of these issues guarantees an interview.)</li>
<li>Senior developer with 3+ years working with Python</li>
<li>Experience with Python web frameworks, specifically Django</li>
<li>3+ years of HTML, Javascript, and CSS (experience with React and/or Typescript is a big plus!)</li>
<li>Experience with unit testing</li>
<li>Comfortable working in a Linux environment, specifically Debian or Ubuntu</li>
<li>Experience with databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Additional Skills:</strong><br><br>
</div><div>You will work on tasks from the following categories, but you can pick up the skills on the job if you haven't mastered these yet:</div><ul>
<li>DevOps experience, especially on Debian/Ubuntu servers, Terraform, Vault, Packer, Prometheus, ELK, Docker. We are building a modern infrastructure and having a strong DevOps presence on top of core software engineering skills is a big plus with us.</li>
<li>Cloud computing, like AWS or OpenStack</li>
<li>Configuration management tools such as Ansible, Consul</li>
<li>RabbitMQ, Redis &amp; Elasticsearch</li>
<li>Mobile development (iOS and/or Android)</li>
<li>Managing clients &amp; projects from beginning to completion (senior developer)</li>
<li>Public speaking at conferences (you would present a talk every year at the Open edX Con)</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Apply for this Position</strong><br><br>
</div><div>Our recruitment process differs from most other companies - we don’t believe resumes and the traditional interviews to be particularly effective. Often, they tell more about how good someone is at interviewing, rather than at the actual work. So, our initial interview is lighter and easier to pass than in other companies - but we then provide you with real (and paid!) work to see how it works out in reality.</div><ul>
<li>Step 1: You apply by filling out this form: <a href="https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/">https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/</a> </li>
<li>Step 2: We do two interviews with candidates matching the requirements listed above. The first interview includes a (simple) coding exercise.</li>
<li>Step 3: If this works out, we hire you! We start with a 2 months <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/processes/#recruitment">trial period</a>, which allows both you and the rest of the team to fully evaluate how we work together, and is followed by a final review and confirmation. </li>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
