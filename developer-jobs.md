<div>We’re looking for an end to end web developer to help us not only build better software but build a better company and have a positive impact on the world around us. We value developers who are able to solve problems using both innovative and pragmatic thinking. As part of a small team, you will be working closely with the CTO/co-founder, 1-2 other developers, and the rest of the company to ensure that we are delivering the best possible solutions to our customers.</div><div><strong><br>Job role</strong></div><div><br></div><div>This role is a combination of new feature development, feature enhancements/maintenance, and bug fixing. For new feature development, you’ll be responsible for building and designing brand new features for our application, like a knowledge base usage report. You’ll need to be able to own that new feature through the entire development cycle (design, build, test, document) and help support it with enhancements and bug fixes after its initial release. We want someone who has the technical chops to build out brand new features and functionalities on the backend and unravel existing functionality and code. It’s a bonus if you also have an eye for UX design.<br><br>
</div><div>Part of your responsibilities will also be to maintain and improve the existing codebase, which includes fixing bugs, troubleshooting, and potential refactoring work. We have a very small team of developers and a legacy codebase. Our size necessitates taking initiative and solving problems you’ve likely never encountered before. We’ve been working hard to modernize all of our tech. While we’ve come a long way, we still have more work to do. If you can find joy in the creative process of implementing improvements without tearing everything down, you will be a major asset to our team.</div><div><br></div><div>In all cases, while we want you to take ownership of your work, that doesn’t mean you’re working in a vacuum. The rest of the team (and anyone else in the company) will gladly help you–but if you’re the lead developer on a feature, we expect you to own it and keep it moving forward. Our ideal candidate is someone who is able to work independently (self-managing) while still being able to collaborate with the rest of the team and the company as a whole. </div><div><br></div><div>Also, if you noticed the “document” part of the feature development cycle and panicked–don’t worry! You’re not expected to write product documentation, but you’ll serve as a subject matter expert for any questions our documentarian might have on features you build.</div><div><br></div><div>Since we’re a small team, there’s an opportunity to wear multiple hats with room to grow. For example, if you are interested in cloud engineering and devops, you would have the opportunity to jump in, learn, and do. A parliament is a group of owls and we try to keep our parliament balanced, with each owl doing the types of work that we enjoy, regardless of role. So we’re not just looking for someone who has a particular skill set, but also someone who’s interested in being part of our collaborative team, who’s comfortable in a code review but also enjoys talking a little bit of company strategy and big picture.</div><div>

<strong>How we work<br></strong><br>
</div><div>What we’re most proud of though is our brilliant, creative, and tenacious team. Our remote-first workplace means you’ll be working with Sendwavers in Europe, Africa, South America, and the U.S. that all share a core set of Sendwave values. What exactly are those values? Glad you asked.<br><br>
</div><ol>
<li>
<strong>Prioritize fearlessly.</strong><br>There will always be more problems to solve and opportunities to pursue than we have the capacity for. We’re not afraid to say no and are willing to let fires burn, knowing that to win we must discern and execute decisively on the vital few rather than the important many.</li>
<li>
<strong>Take full ownership of the outcomes we’re responsible for.</strong><br>Our job is not to do what we can to solve a problem. It's to ensure that problem is solved. If an attempt to solve a problem doesn't work, we seek an alternative. If we need help, we request it, and, if necessary, demand it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Forge a diverse team and inclusive culture.</strong><br>We believe the challenges we’re addressing will be best met by a truly global, diverse team, working together. We’re not naive to the systemic bias and discrimination that make this easier said than done, so we check our egos, listen deeply, and measure progress towards making this a fundamental part of our success.</li>
<li>
<strong>Maximize our rate of learning.</strong><br>We view projects as ever-evolving drafts and welcome opportunities to discover that what we had in mind won't work so we can move to an even better end state. Most importantly, we do this fast. The faster we run these loops — as a company and individuals — the faster we’ll achieve our mission.</li>
<li>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
