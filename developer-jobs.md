<div>Kratzen Partners is recruiting a <strong>full time 100% remote</strong> senior software developer to build an internal toolset for scraping public websites that have been specifically hardened against simple scraping methods.­­ The key to the project’s success will be problem solving, clever experimentation, grit, and creativity. </div><div> </div><div>
<strong>About Us: </strong>Kratzen Partners is a global technology services provider specializing in discovering, collecting, and analyzing internet data and discretely relieving internal information collection operating burdens of the world’s leading data driven corporations and institutions. </div><div> </div><div><strong>Qualifications:</strong></div><div>·      Expert level experience in JavaScript, including web programming</div><div>·      Experience with website scraping, and/or writing stealthy bots</div><div>·      Naturally inquisitive and curious  </div><div>·      A knack for problem-solving, combining creativity and logical thinking<br>       ·      You probably enjoy solving puzzles and brain teasers</div><div>·      Fluent in English, especially written English</div><div>·      <strong><em>BONUS</em></strong>: experience with playwright framework</div><div> </div><div>
<strong>Pay</strong>: €70-85k per year, based on experience. </div><div> </div><div><strong>What the job will be like</strong></div><div>Your initial role will be to build out the MVP for this new advanced scraping toolset, working with a PM and reporting to our VP of engineering, leveraging existing systems designs and experimentation results. However, you will be writing the production code from a blank slate, and there will still be considerable experimentation and problem solving required as we work through the inevitable unexpected hurdles. <br><br>
</div><div>You’ll be primarily work on your own -- your VP and PM will help set direction and be available to brainstorm and provide suggested avenues of exploration. However, the more you can generate your own ideas, plans, and work independently, the better. Initial onboarding  will include daily check-ins, shifting to a 2/week cadence as you get settled. As long as you attend our calls, meet deadlines, and get your work done, you’re welcome to work your own schedule.</div><div> </div><div><strong>Our Interview Process </strong></div><div>1.     Submit an application (instructions below) </div><div>2.     We’ll interview the strongest 8-12 applicants, hopefully including you </div><div>3.     You will complete a small self-paced practical test: reverse engineer a simple, but obfuscated, JavaScript web app. We expect this project to take 2-5 hours. </div><div>4.     You will have a final interview with the product and engineering manager to ensure there is a good fit</div><div>5.     We’ll send you an offer!<br><br>We know interviews are no fun by their very nature. We dont know how how to fix, but please, have lunch on us! We’ll send €20 to anyone that even submits a take home test. </div><div>
<strong> </strong> </div><div><strong>Application Submission</strong></div><div>If this sounds like the right job for you, please send your first and last name, resume, and 2 or 3 sentences for each of following questions to <a href="mailto:careers@kratzenpartners.com">careers@kratzenpartners.com</a> : </div><div> </div><div>1.     What’s your experience scraping internet data?</div><div>2.     What are hard-to-spoof ways to fingerprint what browser someone is actually using?</div><div>3.     Without using the ip address, how might you detect a web client is using a vpn?</div><div>4.     Are there more avenues of detection available if the client is using an https proxy?</div><div> </div><div>
<em>Please remember, THERE ARE NO WRONG ANSWERS to these question!</em> </div>

<li>You have one or multiple projects to complete. You can work on them whenever and however you want without being micromanaged. However, you must be able to meet the deadline and be accountable for the quality of the end solution.<ul><li>You’re also responsible for maintaining the Github repository of the project you’re working on, committing/pushing/documenting your changes, commenting on your code, and writing SOPs or technical documentation (if necessary). It doesn’t have to be pages long and can be very short and concise. But, as a developer, it makes life so much easier if you can return to your code in the future without having to think too hard about what you did. This is also about being considerate of your teammates' time.</li></ul>
</li>

<li>You might have a day where one of our team members needs something urgent and needs it done the same or the next day, which can be valuable to the company, or a major issue needs to be fixed ASAP, in which case you might have to drop what you're working on and work on that or troubleshoot the entire day. If your main project's deadline cannot be met because of this (which is understandable), you should be able to communicate this on time.</li>
<li>However, most of the time you are able to work on your main projects in solitary. We understand that developers need complete focus. You can also chat and ask questions in our Slack channels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You might get stuck in programming and need help, or some development processes may need to be explained. If it cannot be explained/resolved via chat or video, screen-sharing calls can be scheduled throughout the week.</li>

<div>Groove is looking for a very senior full-stack developer to help us accelerate our pursuit of building the best damn customer support tools on the planet. <br><br>You may have heard of us from our <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/top-posts">Journey to 500K blog</a> or from seeing us in places like NY Times, BBC, Forbes, Entrepreneur, Hacker News or elsewhere around the web. <br><br>This gig is not for the unseasoned. We need someone who's been in the trenches and helped grow a B2B SaaS company. A coder and a leader, who can hack with the best of them, and has an appreciation for good design and usability. A craftsman with the fire to help us execute on our product roadmap and move us along on our journey to 10MM in ARR. We've got a tight, scrappy team of former CTOs and founders working to make our app simpler, stronger and better. <br><br>We've put the time into talking with our customers and hitting product/market fit, and and need your help to step on the gas.<br><strong><br>From the technical side, here's what you'll need to know:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Ruby (with and without Rails)  </li>
<li>Expert knowledge of Javascript </li>
<li>In-depth knowledge of React, Redux and GraphQL</li>
<li>Deep understanding of HTML and CSS</li>
<li>Proficient understanding of git</li>
<li>Location: US or EU</li>
</ul><div>Experience working remotely is the only other requirement. You’ll be joining a completely remote team that knows how hackers work best. Meetings are kept to a minimum and everyone is left to get things done. Familiarity with Slack is a plus, and advanced-level Giphy skills will take you far.<br><br>If you’ve helped a fast-moving team win before and are ready to do it again, we want you on board. Our work impacts thousands of businesses around the globe, and we have our sights (very publicly) set on massive growth goals. If you think you can help us get there and are ready to join the family, email us at wewantyou@groovehq.com.<br><br>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </span></p>
