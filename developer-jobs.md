<div>We are looking for a Fullstack developer to join a tightly-knit team and help us develop the Causalytics platform. You do not have to be an expert in every area, or have many years of corporate experience as long as you have been busy with various projects (pro or hobby) and are able and willing to learn (fast) as you go.</div><div> </div><div>We are building a platform that automates decision making for digital advertising. The product was born when we won the Sanoma Data Challenge Hackathon in March 2021.  </div><div> </div><div>Causalytics is a fast-paced growth company with a startup soul. You'll work in a collaborative and inclusive environment built on a culture of trust, transparency and feedback. You will get to take on challenging software problems, but don't worry we will be there to support you.</div><div>​</div><div>​</div><div><strong>What we can offer:</strong></div><ul>
<li>Influence. You'll play an important part in the frequent decisions regarding features, technologies and architecture</li>
<li>Opportunity to learn. You’ll be working on the entire product, not just modules or features. You will learn a lot and you will learn fast, thanks to the pace of a startup in a growth phase.</li>
<li>Focus on one product. Work on, master and own one product rather than scratching the surface of multiple ones or barely supporting multiple projects.</li>
<li>Work with the best. Our first developer, CTO and Co-founder (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-kronstr%C3%B6m-98178923/">John Kronström</a>) is a highly efficient, business-oriented and experienced full-stack developer. He’s also a really nice guy. :)</li>
<li>Modern tools. Only work with the best technologies where the stack or legacy is not a constraint.</li>
<li>Challenge. We're riding on the trend of automating data-driven decision making, so we need to come up with lots of "never seen before" features.</li>
</ul><div>​</div><div>​</div><div><strong>Our current stack consists of:</strong></div><ul>
<li>Vue.js with Vuex and Vuetify</li>
<li>Node.js with Feathers.js and Sequelize</li>

Do you wish to <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">use your coding superpowers for a good cause</strong> and help improve the lives of millions of people around the world?

We understand how critical your superpowers are, and don’t believe in making our dev team work on pointless tasks, nor suffer the consequences of technical decisions being made by people in other departments (we know you’ve been there). Instead, you’ll <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">work on stimulating projects </strong>in a healthy, collaborative environment where<strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;"> your ideas and time are valued</strong>. You’ll be involved in decision-making processes which means there are incredible possibilities for you to <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">take initiative and grow </strong>here. In fact, it’s encouraged! Traditional hierarchies don’t lead to brilliant, effective outcomes, so we’ve thrown them out. </p>

We’re lucky enough to get up each day and <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">build a better future for thousands of people </strong>around the world.

The architecture is a multi-page application — an MVC-based, <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">modular monolith using Laravel</strong> as a back-end framework. It was started back in 2013, and since then we’ve relentlessly increased code quality, features and test coverage, and are proud to say that we have almost zero legacy code or technical debt. We believe a modular monolithic architecture can reach a <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">level of perfection</strong> where it’s <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">superior to a micro-service architecture</strong> — despite an ever-increasing number of features.</p>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul>

Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </span></p>

Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </span></p>
