<h1>About Us</h1><p>Looking to teleport your career to a unicorn set to redefine the creative cosmos? Ready to move faster than Charlie can concoct a new "Charlie Work" scheme? Well, hold up there, speed racer. The good news is, we're not barreling down the same old freeway.</p><p>While other tech firms chug energy drinks at sunrise, prepping for another code-sprint marathon, we prefer to take it down a notch. Picture us as your favorite brunch joint. A place where we savor our coffee, whip up some eggs, and mull over the day's potential.</p><p>We're the Paddy's Pub of the tech world, minus the chaos and crickets.</p><p>Instead of zigzagging wildly and bashing road signs, we cruise smoothly, patching potholes as we go.</p><p>Our compass? It's locked on wisdom-life balance (wlb). We refuse to trade our zen for a nitrous hit. In our game of life, the DELETE key is just as game-changing as the ENTER. We're not racking up user stats, we're tallying the belly laughs.</p><p>While other companies gun for speed records, we question the hidden cost of ventures that burn rubber without a care.</p><p>Our vision? A pit stop where tech fuels human creativity, not saps it. Where AI is your pit crew, fine-tuning your ride, not a cookie-cutter car you're forced into.</p><p>Sure, this scenic route might not be everyone's chosen path. But if the thought of steering tech with mindfulness and flair gets your engine revving, we'd love to chat over a pint of Fight Milk. But let's be clear, we're not sitcom characters. We just think the tech world could use a bit more humor, sustainability, and... soul.</p><p>Oh, and yes, we do have ergonomic captain's chairs, blisteringly fast computers, open communication channels for everyone, and absolutely no rearview mirrors. So, buckle up, and let's redefine what it means to win the race.</p><h1>The Product</h1><p>Imagine this: The gang concocts an app. But it's not your run-of-the-mill variety.</p><p>This is an app that puts the 'human' back in 'human creativity', by tailoring to each user's unique rhythm, like a hit single on repeat. We're serving creators, influencers, and makers here.</p><p>The secret sauce? An AI prowess as wacky as a round of Chardee MacDennis, marrying speech and language processing with an understanding of each user's creative cadence.</p><p>Envision this: Writer Zack gets acquainted with our AI sidekick, a clever entity we fondly call Zelda (no, she's not one of Frank's dubious companions). After a warm intro and a few writing samples, Zelda starts to channel Zack's distinct style. Whether Zack needs a hand decluttering his creative cobwebs or a gentle push of inspiration, Zelda's there, harmonizing with his creative concerto.</p><p>Now, cue musician Marley and his buddy Bob (not Frank's discarded rum ham). Bob's always in sync with Marley's jam sessions and sketching patterns. Whether Marley's on the cusp of a creative epiphany or wrestling with a tough verse, Bob's primed to riff off potential lyrics from Marley's past hits or unearth inspiring instrumental samples. Bob's groove meshes seamlessly with Marley's creative beat.</p><p>The crescendo?</p><ul>
<li><p>We amplify human imagination by a factor of ten</p></li>
<li><p>Think of us as the Health Inspector for data‚Äîkeeping it all under lock and key</p></li>
<li><p>We safeguard creativity and IP like Charlie guards the sanctity of the bar</p></li>
</ul><p>Our AI assistant takes care of the mundane tasks and fine-tuning, freeing creators to mull over those big-picture ideas‚Äîlike the gang strategizing their next wild ploy.</p><p>We're currently brewing a public alpha, aiming to pull back the curtain for all by Q3 2023. Our waitlist is piling up quicker than Frank's mattress stash. What sets us apart? We're one of the rare AI sidekicks crafted to complement, not replace.</p><h1>The Stack</h1><h3>The Playbook üèÄ</h3><p>Our secret sauce starts with Vercel's toolset. Why go on a wild goose chase with a messy stack, when you can bank on Vercel's perfectly synchronized products? It's like having the perfect plan‚Äîit just works!</p><p>We doff our caps to open source communities‚Äîtruly the unsung heroes! But for our MVP, we favored sticking together rather than fiddling with the pieces, avoiding a Frankenstein of a prototype. Vercel gives us that quick head start, with room for DIY flavor down the line. It's like the gang's recipe for their next wild caper!</p><p>With Vercel calling the shots, we're hitting the open road with...</p><h3>A Touch of Next.js üßÇ</h3><p>The turbo to our React engine! Next.js handles the nitty-gritty of page rendering and routing, freeing us to map out our next venture. Plus, it's as speedy as Charlie chugging Fight Milk!</p><p><a href="https://nextjs.org/"><strong>Next.js</strong></a></p><h3>A Hint of Shadcn + Radix üç©</h3><p>These React component gems help us deck out the app with ease.

Make Notion proud with this AI-powered editor.</p><p><a href="https://novel.sh/"><strong>Novel.sh</strong></a></p><h3>A Spoonful of ContentLayer ü•Ñ</h3><p>Navigating content outside of React? This handy-dandy SDK is our lifeboat.</p><p><a href="https://www.contentlayer.dev"><strong>ContentLayer</strong></a></p><h3>A Drop of Clerk üç∏</h3><p>Manages user login like the Waitress handles the gang's eccentricities.</p><p><a href="https://clerk.com/"><strong>Clerk</strong></a></p><h3>A Speck of Vercel Postgres üë©üèæ‚Äçüç≥</h3><p>Bid adieu to data pandemonium ‚Äî this managed SQL database reins in our data, much like Dee attempts with the boys.</p><p><a href="https://vercel.com/docs/postgres"><strong>Vercel Postgres</strong></a></p><h3>A Pinch of Vercel KV ü§èüèΩ</h3><p>Craving for lightning-fast caching?

Savor the goodness! üç∞</p><p><a href="http://vercel.com/"><strong>Vercel</strong></a></p><h1><strong>Seeking Senior Full Stack Developer</strong></h1><p>Are you the kind of code wizard who breathes Python, Rust, and React like it's fresh sea air? Ever catch yourself daydreaming about AI and ML, or get that adrenaline rush when you're riding the gnarly wave of cutting-edge tech?

<p>
  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> Fully remote company (worldwide, incorporated in Berlin)
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://opencraft.com/">https://opencraft.com/</a>
</p>

<div>Do you care about contributing to open-source, and appreciate a good challenge? We do too! :)¬†<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Open-source<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are a team of veteran open-source developers, working on educational and community-based projects in an<a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/open_first/"> open-first</a> environment ‚Äì and we are looking for new members. By joining us, you will work full-time on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums.¬†</div><div>
<br>We care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.</div><div>
<br><strong>Remote-first</strong>
</div><div>
<br>Unlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it‚Äôs none of our business when or where you work from. :)</div><div>
<br>We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!). We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good documentation practices.</div><div>
<br><strong>Online education<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are one of the main contributors to the <a href="https://open.edx.org/">Open edX project</a>, the main open-source MOOC platform created by MIT, Harvard and many other top universities. It powers sites like <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, the <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library">MIT Open Learning Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fun-mooc.fr/">national online learning platform for France</a>. We provide development and hosting for institutions like <a href="https://onlinelearning.hms.harvard.edu/hmx/">Harvard Medical School</a>, <a href="https://www.labxchange.org">Harvard LabXchange</a>, <a href="https://ondemand.cloudera.com">Cloudera</a>, <a href="https://www.upskill.autodesk.com">Autodesk</a>, and several governments. We are not affiliated with <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a>, but we contribute and work with them on various projects.¬†</div><div>
<br><strong>Technical stack</strong><br><br>
</div><div>The Open edX project is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. Tasks are varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working full-stack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Contracting terms<br></strong><br>
</div><div>This is a full-time, permanent contract position. We aim for long-term relationships -- once in, almost all team members stay for many years.¬†</div><div><br></div><div>We care about paying fairly:¬†</div><ul>
<li>Team members set their own compensation level, which is paid based on hours worked (no unpaid overtime!).¬†</li>
<li>When determining your rate, we will expect you to factor in benefits (vacation, healthcare, purchase budgets, etc.) - the idea is to let <em>you</em> pick the benefits that are useful to you, rather than offer one-size-fits-all packages that aren‚Äôt always very valuable.</li>
<li>We also proactively apply generous raises team-wide, based on the company results at the end of each year. <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/team_compensation/">See the details about how we approach compensation in our handbook</a>.</li>
</ul><div>We also firmly believe in work-life balance: as long as you deliver what you commit to, there is a lot of latitude in how much work you can choose to accept. We are open to time commitments anywhere in the 30h to 40h/week range, and highly discourage working more than that. It‚Äôs important to have time to ourselves, as well as having some slack, and there are diminishing returns in working more anyway. We are currently recruiting precisely to preserve that balance, and ensure we have plenty of capacity to handle our projects.</div><div><br></div><div>We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.</div><div>
<br><strong>Basic Requirements:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Experience with contributing to free software projects - small contributions are completely fine, but you <em>must</em> have at least one patch or pull request merged in a third-party project, or been a maintainer of an open source project with significant adoption. (Note that you can contribute now to satisfy this requirement - see for example the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/build-test-release-wg/projects/1">Open edX release issues</a>, fixing one of these issues guarantees an interview.)</li>
<li>Senior developer with 3+ years working with Python</li>
<li>Experience with Python web frameworks, specifically Django</li>
<li>3+ years of HTML, Javascript, and CSS (experience with React and/or Typescript is a big plus!)</li>
<li>Experience with unit testing</li>
<li>Comfortable working in a Linux environment, specifically Debian or Ubuntu</li>
<li>Experience with databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Additional Skills:</strong><br><br>
</div><div>You will work on tasks from the following categories, but you can pick up the skills on the job if you haven't mastered these yet:</div><ul>
<li>DevOps experience, especially on Debian/Ubuntu servers, Terraform, Vault, Packer, Prometheus, ELK, Docker. We are building a modern infrastructure and having a strong DevOps presence on top of core software engineering skills is a big plus with us.</li>
<li>Cloud computing, like AWS or OpenStack</li>
<li>Configuration management tools such as Ansible, Consul</li>
<li>RabbitMQ, Redis &amp; Elasticsearch</li>
<li>Mobile development (iOS and/or Android)</li>
<li>Managing clients &amp; projects from beginning to completion (senior developer)</li>
<li>Public speaking at conferences (you would present a talk every year at the Open edX Con)</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Apply for this Position</strong><br><br>
</div><div>Our recruitment process differs from most other companies - we don‚Äôt believe resumes and the traditional interviews to be particularly effective. Often, they tell more about how good someone is at interviewing, rather than at the actual work. So, our initial interview is lighter and easier to pass than in other companies - but we then provide you with real (and paid!) work to see how it works out in reality.</div><ul>
<li>Step 1: You apply by filling out this form: <a href="https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/">https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/</a>¬†</li>
<li>Step 2: We do two interviews with candidates matching the requirements listed above. The first interview includes a (simple) coding exercise.</li>
<li>Step 3: If this works out, we hire you! We start with a 2 months <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/processes/#recruitment">trial period</a>, which allows both you and the rest of the team to fully evaluate how we work together, and is followed by a final review and confirmation.¬†</li>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A¬∑Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing.¬†</p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A¬∑Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A¬∑Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A¬∑Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="">
<li style=""><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A¬∑Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.¬†</li>
<li style=""><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li style=""><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A¬∑Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
