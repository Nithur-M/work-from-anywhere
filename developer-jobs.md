                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A¬∑Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing.¬†</p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A¬∑Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A¬∑Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A¬∑Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A¬∑Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.¬†</li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A¬∑Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>

Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.¬†</span></p>

    <div class="content-conclusion"><h3>BUILD IN A WEEKEND. SCALE TO BILLIONS</h3>
<p>Supabase adds auth, realtime, and restful APIs to Postgres without a single line of code.</p>
<p>Each project within Supabase is an isolated&nbsp;Postgres cluster, allowing customers to scale independently, while still providing the features that you need to build: instant database setup, auth, row level security, realtime data streams, auto-generating APIs, and a simple to use web interface.</p>
<p>We are a fully remote company.</p>
<p>Key Tech: Javascript, Typescript, Go, Elixir, PostgREST (haskell), Postgres, Pulumi.</p>
<h3><a id="about-the-team" class="anchor"></a>About the team</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're a startup. It's unstructured.</li>
<li>Collectively founded more than a dozen venture-backed companies.</li>
<li>More than 10 different nationalities.</li>
<li>We deeply believe in <a href="https://supabase.com/blog/2022/03/25/should-i-open-source-my-company" target="_blank">the efficacy of collaborative open source</a>. We support existing communities and tools, rather than building "yet another xx".</li>
<li>We "dogfood" everything. If you use it in your project, we use it in Supabase.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="process" class="anchor"></a>Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>The entire process is fully remote and all communication will happen over email or via video chat.</li>
<li>Once you've submitted your application, the team will review your submission, and may reach out for a short screening interview over video call.</li>
<li>If you pass the screen you will be invited to up to four follow up interviews. The calls:
<ul>
<li>usually take between 20-45 minutes each depending on the interviewer.</li>
<li>are all 1:1.</li>
<li>will be with both founders, a member of either the growth or engineering team (depending on the role), and usually one other person from your immediate team or function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the interviews are over, the team will meet to discuss several roles and candidates and may:
<ul>
<li>ask one or two follow-up questions over email or a quick call.</li>
<li>go directly to making an offer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
