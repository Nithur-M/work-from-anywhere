&lt;p&gt;Established in 2013, Xapo has pioneered Crypto Banking while earning a reputation as the Fort Knox of Crypto.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Optimize the website, SEO, and contribute to CMS integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great understanding of the newest trends, best practices and standards in web development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in leading the development of medium to large-scale projects, focusing on UX and Security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of server-side CSS pre-processing platforms&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient understanding of client-side scripting, security best practices, and browser performance optimizations&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great knowledge of advanced JavaScript libraries and frameworks, such as AngularJS, ReactJS, Next (at least one of them), etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good understanding of asynchronous request handling, partial page updates, SPA, SSG&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with tools such as Figma and Lokalise is a plus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient understanding of cross-browser compatibility issues and ways to work around them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient understanding of code versioning tools, such as GitHub.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good knowledge of SEO principles and ensuring that applications will adhere to them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent attention to detail with a high level of ownership mentality to deliver results independently and iteratively.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other requirements&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dedicated workspace.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Software Engineer on the Developer Experience and Integrations team, you will be responsible for building and maintaining customer-facing integrations between Fingerprint and third-party cloud providers, such as Cloudflare, AWS, Fastly, and Akamai. Your work will enable customers to seamlessly integrate Fingerprint’s device intelligence solutions into their existing infrastructure, enhancing security not only for authentication but for any critical action or transaction that requires protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will contribute to both backend integrations (Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda, API-driven security measures) and customer-facing features in our dashboard, which is primarily written in React and Node.js, with some backend services in Go. Additionally, you will play a key role in maintaining and improving our open-source ecosystem, including a wide range of Server API SDKs, frontend libraries, and mobile libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your code will be executed millions of times daily, ensuring accurate device intelligence and seamless protection for our customers’ most sensitive workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Implement API-based and edge-based security logic, ensuring seamless communication between Fingerprint, cloud services, and customers’ infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain and improve our open-source ecosystem, including Server API SDKs, frontend libraries, and mobile libraries to ensure seamless developer adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with SDKs and open-source projects that enable customers to integrate Fingerprint’s device intelligence into their workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with product managers, engineers, and designers to improve customer experience and technical performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write internal and public documentation to guide customers in integrating Fingerprint with third-party cloud platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-5 years of experience with at least a couple of the following technologies: JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, .NET, Kotlin, Flutter, React Native.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-3 years of experience working with Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda, or similar edge computing platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience integrating third-party services and APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on customer-facing products, such as dashboards, SDKs, or developer tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with SDK and library development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work asynchronously in a remote-based team, with excellent communication skills and attention to detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep interest in cloud platforms, open-source development, and developer experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Role requires proficiency with macOS and comfort working fully remotely using tools such as Slack, Google Workspace, and Zoom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To demonstrate your attention to detail, please include the current major version of the Fingerprint Pro Server Python SDK into the box below&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nice to have:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working with additional cloud platforms, such as Akamai, Fastly, Azure Functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributions to open-source projects or published technical content related to integrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in technical writing for API and integration documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for someone passionate about customer-facing integrations, cloud security, edge computing, and developer experience, while also maintaining and improving our open-source ecosystem and existing integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em data-stringify-type=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;The base salary range for this role is $120,000 - $170,000. For cash compensation, we set standard ranges for all&lt;strong&gt; US based roles based on function, level and geographic location&lt;/strong&gt;, benchmarked against similar stage growth companies. In order to be compliant with local legislation, as well as to provide greater transparency to candidates, we share salary ranges on all job postings regardless of desired hiring location. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including geographic location as well as candidate experience and expertise, and may vary from the amounts listed above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
