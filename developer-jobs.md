                <p style="min-height:1.5em">As a blockchain developer, you will architect and build solutions to specific problems, and review implementations and existing solutions. Solutions will be for a range of problems: they may consist of smart contracts, modifications to blockchain infrastructure, or tooling to automate the detection of particular concerns.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Your day-to-day work will involve developing software and designing systems in collaboration with researchers and other developers. You may be working on problems that may never have been solved before, or you may be augmenting existing tools to add functionality. You may need to evaluate techniques and explore existing tools. Some projects and problems to solve will arise from internal requirements, while others will come from clients, and others still will be a result of community initiatives. You may be asked to compare and understand systems you’re not familiar with, and you should be comfortable doing this. Ideally you have a strong ability to read and write code - the specific language is not too important, but both on-chain and off-chain coding experience is valuable. You may be asked to present your work internally.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><p style="min-height:1.5em">You will be helping with smooth operation of blockchain systems, helping to identify causes, and fix them afterwards.

Said differently, most engineers want to have influence over the <em>technology</em> they work on or with. There’s nothing wrong with that, we love hardcore engineers.

                &lt;p&gt;As the publisher of Ubuntu we serve millions of developers, building for the cloud, IoT and data science. We aim to make open source easier and more reliable for innovators and enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have created a new Developer Relations team to engage directly with open source communities and developer-centric organisations. We hope both to communicate our vision and products for better open source development experiences, and also to have a better feedback loop from those audiences to shape our offerings and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Developer Relations Engineer is a technical expert, strategist and communicator with deep empathy for developers. This discipline combines practical engineering skills with firm diplomacy across organisational boundaries, in both directions. Like our audience, a Developer Relations Engineer is never satisfied with the status quo, and is driven by an insatiable curiosity to find better ways to get things done. They are problem-solvers and inventors, who understand people&#39;s needs and love the way that tools can be adapted to meet them. They stay current with tech trends and provide insights and guidance while fostering innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve your chances of success in this application, read our advice on &lt;a href=&quot;https://canonical.com/blog/how-to-get-a-job-at-canonical&quot;&gt;how to get a job at Canonical&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;we are building our initial DevRel team in Europe, Middle East, African and American time zones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What your day will look like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical day, a developer relations engineer might:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take part in team product meetings, at levels from strategy to day-by-day development progress, contributing insight and expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintain conversations with developer community members wherever they may be found - IRC, social media, product forums, meet-ups and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work with colleagues in other teams in the company, as part of efforts to help establish commonality and consistent approaches&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;help solve specific technical problems that users or colleagues have identified&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contribute to technical documentation to ensure that developer users&#39; needs are met there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work on technical articles, presentations or workshops&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify new opportunities and directions for improvement in the developer experience we provide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;present at conferences, meetups or technical events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;understands current software packing issues and trends in the Linux ecosystem&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has been a contributor to open-source communities, software and documentation&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;can work effectively, tactfully, empathetically and confidently in contexts where different parties have different perspectives, needs and understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;builds trust, relationships and confidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is willing to travel globally twice a year for company events, as well as to upstream and partner events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;previous experience in a developer advocacy or community role&lt;/li&gt;

We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person - we’ve been working remotely since 2004!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual compensation review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognition rewards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual holiday leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maternity and paternity leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employee Assistance Programme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity to travel to new locations to meet colleagues from your team and others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priority Pass for travel and travel upgrades for long haul company events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
