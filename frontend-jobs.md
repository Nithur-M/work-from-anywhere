&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of our positions are fully remote. You do not have to relocate to join us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The position&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll join a team of approximately 200 engineers across Frontend, Backend, SRE, Data, and QA. We&#39;re organized into cross-functional development teams assigned to specific verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is open for several teams, and we will define the exact team you will be joining during the interview process based on the business needs and your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the specific team, you will be working on building tools, APIs, and integrations for one of our products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our backend is built with Elixir and Phoenix, with a Postgres database. We use React, Next.js, and Typescript for our frontend. Gitlab is used for version control and as a CI/CD solution. Our issue tracker is Linear. Our applications are hosted on AWS. We fully rely on our CI for deployments and deploy multiple times per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What this job can offer you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex and meaningful challenges — solving them will enable people and businesses to live and operate in any country of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity to have a significant impact on the business — we are still very early in our journey as a company, and each change you make today is amplified by the company&#39;s growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom to organize your work and life —&amp;nbsp;you are not bound to daily stand-ups, recurring meetings or other ceremonies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive salary, stock options, unlimited PTO and a set of perks and benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A supportive and kind work environment where we would like you to challenge the dogmas and pursue innovation!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you bring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significant experience as a Frontend Engineer, which includes building, shipping, and maintaining a feature-rich software project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid knowledge and experience in React and Next.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in JavaScript, as well as semantic HTML and CSS&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote is solving global remote organizations’ biggest challenge: employing anyone anywhere compliantly. We make it possible for businesses big and small to employ a global team by handling global payroll, benefits, taxes, and compliance. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://remote.com/how-it-works&quot;&gt;remote.com/how-it-works&lt;/a&gt; to learn more or if you’re interested in adding to the mission, scroll down to apply now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take a look at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://remote.com/handbook&quot;&gt;remote.com/handbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to learn more about our culture and what it is like to work here. &lt;strong&gt;Not only do we encourage folks from all ethnic groups, genders, sexuality, age and abilities to apply, but we prioritize a sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/people-Belonging-Diversity-Equity-Inclusion-DEI-4990e36a7d7b4d52a78ca3efb23d718b&quot;&gt;belonging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; You can check out independent reviews by other candidates on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Remote-EI_IE3871683.11,17.htm&quot;&gt;Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt; or look up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/people-Candidate-Experience-Surveys-17d595a88b7548148593792a8072235f&quot;&gt;results of our candidate surveys&lt;/a&gt; to see how others feel about working and interviewing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of our positions are fully remote. You do not have to relocate to join us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The position&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll join a team of approximately 200 engineers across Frontend, Backend, SRE, Data, and QA. We&#39;re organized into cross-functional development teams assigned to specific verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is open for several teams, and we will define the exact team you will be joining during the interview process based on the business needs and your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the specific team, you will be working on building tools, APIs, and integrations for one of our products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our backend is built with Elixir and Phoenix, with a Postgres database. We use React, Next.js, and Typescript for our frontend. Gitlab is used for version control and as a CI/CD solution. Our issue tracker is Linear. Our applications are hosted on AWS. We fully rely on our CI for deployments and deploy multiple times per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What this job can offer you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex and meaningful challenges — solving them will enable people and businesses to live and operate in any country of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity to have a significant impact on the business — we are still very early in our journey as a company, and each change you make today is amplified by the company&#39;s growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom to organize your work and life —&amp;nbsp;you are not bound to daily stand-ups, recurring meetings or other ceremonies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive salary, stock options, unlimited PTO and a set of perks and benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A supportive and kind work environment where we would like you to challenge the dogmas and pursue innovation!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you bring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 7 years of experience as a Frontend Engineer or Full-Stack Engineer, which includes building, shipping, and maintaining a feature-rich software project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 4 years working with React.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid knowledge and experience in React and Next.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in JavaScript, as well as semantic HTML and CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with TypeScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in dealing with ambiguity, taking abstract concepts and turning them into working software`&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong ability to work independently and self-guided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiosity and willingness to learn and develop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working in HR or Fintech projects is a plus&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you’ll plan your day (and life)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work async at Remote which means you can plan your schedule around your life (and not around meetings). Read more at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.remote.com/async&quot;&gt;remote.com/async&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be empowered to take ownership and be proactive. When in doubt you will default to action instead of waiting. Your &lt;strong&gt;life-work balance&lt;/strong&gt; is important and you will be encouraged to put yourself and your family first, and fit work around your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like something you want, apply now!&lt;/p&gt;
