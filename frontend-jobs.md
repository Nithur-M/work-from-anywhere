                <h2>About Clerk</h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">Clerk is on a mission to solve user management <strong>once and for all.</strong> We are a globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide developers with full-stack React components and hooks like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up">&lt;SignUp/&gt;</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in">&lt;SignIn/&gt;</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile">&lt;UserProfile/&gt;</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-user">useUser</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization">useOrganization</a>. These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization management flows. We believe that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4">a component is worth a thousand APIs</a>.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Our Dashboard is a primary tool for configuring our components, as well as a centralized place for managing your app’s users.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h2>What you will do</h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">We’re a small but growing team, with big ambitions. This means you’ll have responsibility far beyond closing out pre-sliced tickets. We’re looking for people that are comfortable working across the stack to solve <strong>product</strong> problems for real users. While we’re hiring for a role that is focused on our Dashboard product, you’ll come to find that our Dashboard is a crucial way for Clerk to dogfood our own product; and therefore is also critical for generating product feedback and driving the direction of Clerk as a business.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We will expect you to:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Collaborate with customers and teammates</strong> - be part of a world-class product delivery team that cares deeply about customer needs and the value of constant iteration. We’re fully remote, which means you’ll need to practice good communication habits to keep things moving.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Care about frontend architecture</strong> - you’ll work hand-in-glove with multiple teams doing feature development. You’ll need to help us maintain the architecture that they are building on</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Execute</strong><em> -</em> Clerk values engineers who execute. That means approaching work iteratively and reducing the time between feedback cycles.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Thrive in a dynamic environment</strong> <em>-</em> Clerk is not well suited for engineers who expect every task to be a series of predefined steps. We believe the best approach is to -work- through our customer’s problems in the trenches and not merely -think- through them from the sidelines.</p></li></ul><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Go deep</strong> - We want Clerk to be the easiest way for app builder’s to release and operate their businesses. To do this, we need to build the best DX on the market. This means developing deep empathy for app builder’s and knowing the full depth of our customer’s pain points.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Embrace a </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hP80tzBL4"><strong>culture of craft</strong></a> by focusing on engineering quality. We want our product to be best-in-class, and so we need our team to write maintainable, performant, and well-structured code.</p></li></ul><h2>Who you are</h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’re excited by the challenges that come with owning the “back of the frontend” for the Clerk Dashboard. You should be excited by the technical challenges and architectural patterns that enable best-in-class Web Applications.</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’re a Typescript/Javascript expert and opinionated around what makes a high-quality Developer Experience.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You write clean, idiomatic code and know your way around the modern frontend stacks.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’re comfortable establishing high quality patterns that other developers adhere to and you fight to maintain those high standards as the product grows in maturity.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’re passionate about Web App performance (think <em>Web Vitals</em> but also human-centered performance topics like optimistic UI)</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You understand what it takes to build a SaaS product.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You set a high bar for code quality, system design, and performance — and you’re not afraid to fight for it.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You believe in solving real customer problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens.</p></li></ul><h2>Benefits</h2><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Competitive Salary</strong> – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Equity Ownership</strong> – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Work Gear</strong> - Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Flexible Vacation Policy</strong> – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>Diverse and Inclusive Team</strong> – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.</p></li></ul>
