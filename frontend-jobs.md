We also offer <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/meetprivacypro/" rel="noopener">Privacy Pro</a>, a three-in-one subscription service that includes a VPN, Personal Information Removal, and Identity Theft Restoration.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We’re looking for a <strong>Senior Frontend Engineer</strong> to help shape our all-in-one privacy solution and join our mission to show the world that protecting your privacy online can be simple.  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong> </p>
<p>In this role, you will lead and contribute to developing new and existing products and features, demonstrating ownership over major components of our codebase while taking responsibility for their maintenance and improvement over time.

<p><br /></p>
<p>As a senior engineer, you will mentor peers and work closely with cross-functional team members through remote collaboration opportunities, including product brainstorms, technical design discussions, code reviews, and more.</p>
