None of this could happen without our user interface and that’s where you come in. We’re looking for someone with strong product sensibilities, extraordinarily good frontend skills, and solid software engineering fundamentals to join our team to advance the state of the art in our product and our industry.</div><div><br></div><div>We are hiring for<b> multiple frontend software engineer positions.</b></div><h3>Why choose Metabase</h3><li>The problems we face are genuinely interesting and aren’t trivial. Data influences so much of our world but isn’t that easy to interact with or understand. You’ll make tools that people rely on for their real jobs.</li><li>You’ll get to work in open source and get feedback directly from users and customers out in the open.</li><li>The company is growing and so is the business. We’re adding new remote team members from around the world and improving our processes. It’s an exciting time and you can really have an impact on how things work here.</li><li>We’ve tried to design our work environment to fit into real life. Work is only one part of who you are, so we emphasize reasonable workdays and prefer planning and avoiding panic. People at Metabase have families, dogs, plants, and lives outside of work and we try to support that however we can.</li><h3>What we're looking for</h3><li><b>You care about crafting delightful user experiences</b>. You like to write code to enable people to do something and you understand that details and things like copy matter. If your focus is only on code this might not be the best role for you.</li><li><b>Prior experience shipping non-trivial apps using React + Redux (or equivalent)</b>. Our front end is written in React (surprise!), so you’ll need really strong React and JavaScript knowledge to build fast and thoughtful user interfaces.</li><li>You have experience <b>writing tests, giving good feedback on other people’s code</b>, and writing proposals for more complicated problems that are thoughtful and clear. As we’re a remote company (even outside of pandemics) <b>communication and clarity are really important</b><a rel="noopener noreferrer" class="postings-link" href="http://important.Due">.</a></li><li>Due to the nature of what we work on, computer science-y problems come up frequently. We’re not picky about a specific degree or accolade, but you’ll be expected to <b>write fast and performant code</b> and deal with a fair bit of <b>data structure manipulation</b> regularly.</li><li>We like everyone to care about the nuts and bolts of how to make things look good, so you’ll be expected to use our style guide and if necessary write or update our CSS, <b>so comfort in CSS and familiarity with things like design systems and component libraries is a necessity</b><a rel="noopener noreferrer" class="postings-link" href="http://necessity.You">.</a></li><li>You’ve worked on a large and complex JavaScript project. Metabase is a big product and code base so the <b>ability to adapt existing code and integrate new code into established systems</b> is important and you should feel comfortable digging in.</li><h3>Not essential, but nice to have</h3><li>Knowledge and prior experience with data visualization (especially if it has involved dc.js and d3.js).</li><li>Previous contributions to open source (not a requirement, but a huge plus).</li><li>Either pre-existing knowledge or interest in learning some Clojure, the language much of the backend of our application is written in.</li><h3>The types of problems you'd get to work on</h3><li>Lightning fast interaction with data. Think things like letting people see all the orders that came in from a specific region by clicking directly on a custom map of their sales regions and then letting them filter that list visually by directly interacting with the data table - and all of this happening in a responsive and delightful way.</li><li>Augmenting visualizations. To allow for people to further institutional knowledge, build the feature to allow annotations directly on specific data points in a line chart, and then determine how to expose those when it makes sense across dashboards and the entire app.</li><li>Wayfinding. We want to make sure people don’t have to do work that’s already been done, so build new ways to surface important metrics or segments to the right users across Metabase.</li><li>Embedded analytics. We have customers who deliver analytics to their own users via our embed product. You’d get to tackle the problem of making sure those can match their own products visually and enable easier integration of the embeds into their own code.</li><div>We're a global team (50% outside the US), fully distributed (from Thailand to California), who get things done asynchronously, with plenty of uninterrupted time, supporting each other to do the best work of our careers. We offer flexibility (define your own schedule and work from wherever you want), autonomy, and an environment that fosters growth, learning, and development. We're relentlessly user-focused and believe in building long-term value, not short-term hacks. And we raised a $30M Series B to take our approach to the next level for years to come.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 10px">For U.S. applicants: Metabase participates in the federal E-Verify program, which confirms employment authorization of newly hired U.S. based employees.

We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 52 to 91 last year and we expect to grow again in 2024.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h3>The Job</h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus works in an industry dominated by outdated technology that is ripe for fresh thinking: our core competitors rely on massive call centers to screen clients, antiquated CRMs to track and manage cases, and paper checks to get paid (provided they’re sent to the right address). </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Conversely, as a VC-backed tech company our product &amp; engineering department powers everything we do: from creating an engaging online experience for people in crisis to providing tools for our network lawyers as they serve our clients, Atticus relies on technology to fulfill our mission. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We’re looking for Software Engineers to join our team. You’ll work on the front-end, and will partner with every department at Atticus as we continue to grow our platform to help people in need find trusted legal support. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em"> </p><p style="min-height:1.5em"><strong>What You'll Do:</strong></p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Design, build and operate Atticus’ front-end applications written in React with a focus on performance, modularity, extensibility, and reliability.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Architect, design, write, review, and test code in a collaborative environment with other software engineers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Work with product to evaluate and refine product details and acceptance criteria</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Evaluate new front-end technologies and methodologies with an eye toward scalability and performance.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Leverage your peers as multipliers for your skills to create excellent products and services.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">The role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup that doubles as a B-corp social enterprise. Every project you take on will help clients in need get the help they deserve, and you’ll shape our company culture as we scale. We’re looking for engineers who are excited about our mission and the challenges it entails.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h3><strong>Qualifications</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">Required:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have 5+ years of experience writing idiomatic JavaScript/ Node.js</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have experience and love for building performant React applications</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You speak CSS and HTML fluently and know how to build around browser limitations</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You enjoy working with UI and UX experts to build compelling user experiences</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You enjoy helping your teammates grow their front-end skillset</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You use a modern version-control system for your source code repository (Git, Mercurial, GitHub, BitBucket).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You lint all your code or know you should.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You know what parts of your code require tests and you write those tests.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You use objective judgment in leveraging the right frameworks and technologies.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are versed in cloud computing systems (GCP, AWS, etc.) and SAAS concepts.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You leverage continuous integration systems to their full extent (CircleCI, Bamboo, Jenkins, TravisCI).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You plan for, build, evolve and scrutinize monitoring and alerting for your production systems.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are willing and able to deploy, troubleshoot, and maintain your systems in production and staging environments.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">Bonus / Nice-to-Have:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have experience with Golang, Java, Python, Scala, or Ruby</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You like working with Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, Git, Golang, Java</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are well versed in working with GraphQL, GraphQL Federation, REST APIs and supporting network protocols</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You can build a great Webpack configuration</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team.

But we care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p>
