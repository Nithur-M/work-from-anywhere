&lt;p&gt;Remote is solving global remote organizations’ biggest challenge: employing anyone anywhere compliantly. We make it possible for businesses big and small to employ a global team by handling global payroll, benefits, taxes, and compliance. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://remote.com/how-it-works&quot;&gt;remote.com/how-it-works&lt;/a&gt; to learn more or if you’re interested in adding to the mission, scroll down to apply now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take a look at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://remote.com/handbook&quot;&gt;remote.com/handbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to learn more about our culture and what it is like to work here. &lt;strong&gt;Not only do we encourage folks from all ethnic groups, genders, sexuality, age and abilities to apply, but we prioritize a sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/people-Belonging-Diversity-Equity-Inclusion-DEI-4990e36a7d7b4d52a78ca3efb23d718b&quot;&gt;belonging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; You can check out independent reviews by other candidates on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Remote-EI_IE3871683.11,17.htm&quot;&gt;Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt; or look up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/people-Candidate-Experience-Surveys-17d595a88b7548148593792a8072235f&quot;&gt;results of our candidate surveys&lt;/a&gt; to see how others feel about working and interviewing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the specific team, you will be working on building tools, APIs, and integrations for one of our products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our backend is built with Elixir and Phoenix, with a Postgres database. We use React, Next.js, and Typescript for our frontend. Gitlab is used for version control and as a CI/CD solution.
