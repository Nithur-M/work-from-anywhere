<div><strong>About Us</strong></div><div>
<a href="https://close.com/">Close</a> is a bootstrapped, profitable, 100% remote, ~70 person team of thoughtful individuals who value autonomy and impact. We‚Äôre eager to make a product our customers fall in love with over and over again.</div><div><br></div><div>We ‚ù§Ô∏è startups &amp; SMBs. Since 2013, we‚Äôve been building a CRM¬† that focuses on better communication, without the hassle of manual data entry or complex UI. Our goal: double the productivity of every sales rep.</div><div><br></div><div>Our app‚Äôs frontend is a single-page JavaScript web app mostly written in React (originally built with <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>). We bundle with Webpack and target only modern browsers. We test with Jest and React Testing Library. Our UI updates in near real-time and is written in LESS/CSS (with flexbox and grid layout) using CSS modules and takes advantage of fun technologies like Websockets and WebRTC. We house our design system in Storybook.</div><div><br></div><div>We care about performance (e.g. route-based code splitting), maintainability, and testability of our frontend code. We sweat the UI/UX details and work collaboratively with the Product team throughout the design process. This means diving into lo-fi wireframes, and communicating continuously when those ideas are brought to life using Figma and code.</div><div><br></div><div>Our frontend app is built on top of our REST API &amp; GraphQL endpoints. Our backend <a href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close">tech stack</a> consists of Python/Flask, MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. We run our services in Docker on AWS.</div><div><br></div><div>We ‚ù§Ô∏è open sourcing our code and ideas on <a href="https://github.com/closeio">our GitHub</a> and on <a href="https://making.close.com/">The Making of Close</a>, our behind-the-scenes Product &amp; Engineering blog.

    <div class="content-intro"><p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FIdU8GJWQAUGWRA?format=jpg&amp;name=small" alt="Join Supabase" width="680" height="453"></p></div>

    <p>Supabase is an Open Source and fully remote company building developer tools for hundreds of thousands of indie developers, startups, and businesses.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre seeking a Technical Documentation Lead to build our <a href="https://supabase.com/docs">documentation</a>. Emphasis on <em>building</em>, where you will also work with various teams to help them document their products.</p>
<p>We believe that documentation is more than just a tool. It‚Äôs part of our product. The documentation is where developers take their first step on their side project.</p>
<p>We know our docs need a lot of work, and that‚Äôs why we need you. If you have ideas for what the best docs in the world would look like, we want you to join us and make that happen.</p>
<h2>Who we need:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Key Criteria
<ul>
<li><strong>Frontend skills:</strong> you must be proficient in Next.js/React. The site is under heavy development, and it will be your task to maintain the docs and create new features.</li>
<li><strong>Supabase experience:</strong> you need to know about the Supabase products and benefits better than anyone, so that you can clearly articulate them to developers.</li>
<li><strong>Writing/Editing ability:</strong> You write concisely. We like short sentences. We don‚Äôt like fluff. You‚Äôre not required to write <em>all</em> the docs, but you will be the final checkpoint before they get merged into production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Important Criteria
<ul>
<li><strong>Previous experience with docs:</strong> You know how to structure docs. Have an understanding that your structure is to help search engines find things as well as humans. You understand the communication level of docs. Guides vs Reference Level. Understand how to and when to link to other parts of the docs.</li>
<li><strong>Product Management experience:</strong> in this role you will be a bit of a ‚Äúdocs enforcer‚Äù, cajoling the Supabase teams to write docs as part of their product development. It‚Äôs not done until it‚Äôs documented, and it‚Äôs your job to make that happen.</li>
<li><strong>Writing experience:</strong> the more experience you‚Äôve had with writing the better your writing is going to be.</li>
<li><strong>DevRel experience:</strong> The goal of documentation is to give developers the best experience possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>General mindset
<ul>
<li>You love developer tools. That‚Äôs the content you‚Äôll be writing about every day.</li>
<li>You are collaborative. You‚Äôll be working with basically everyone in the company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who we don‚Äôt need</h2>
<ul>
<li>A manager. You won‚Äôt need to manage a team of people to write docs. You will be the developer, editor, and the owner of documentation as a product.</li>
<li>A designer. You won‚Äôt need to come up with icons and font-selections. If you can pencil an idea onto paper, we‚Äôll turn it into something cool.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some skills that will be useful</h2>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge of SQL and databases (specifically databases).</li>
<li>Know how to create images or videos/gifs. We love visual docs (and generally anything to write less words).</li>
<li>Understanding of SEO</li>
</ul>
<h2>We offer</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>100% remote work from anywhere in the world. No location-based adjustment to your salary.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autonomous work. We work collaboratively on projects, but you set your own pace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health, Vision and Dental benefits. Supabase covers 100% of the cost for employees and 80% for dependants</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generous Tech Allowance for any office setup you need</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annual Education Allowance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annually run off-sites.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
