We are looking for talented software engineers to help us level the playing field in education by building the most effective test preparation available, bar none. We believe that the best way to build this experience is by creating a diverse team of people from different backgrounds, races, religions, genders, sexual orientations, ages, and experiences. The team we are building must be aligned to our core values of:</p>
<ul> <li> <strong>Go pro.</strong> Or go home. Get better than the best.</li> <li> <strong>Do right.</strong> Period.</li> <li> <strong>Make it happen.</strong> Excuses never built anything.</li> <li> <strong>Make it awesome.</strong> There is no equality without quality.</li> <li> <strong>Customers are forever.</strong> This company is for them.</li> </ul>
