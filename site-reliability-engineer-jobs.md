                <p>Hi, we’re DuckDuckGo, the Internet privacy company for everyone who wants to take back their privacy now. For over a decade, we've been building our all-in-one product, developing new privacy technology, and working with policymakers to make online privacy simple and accessible for all. <br /></p>

Our private search engine is also 3rd in market share in the U.S. and over 20 major markets. Oh, and we've been profitable since 2014, with annual revenue exceeding $100 million!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><em>The DuckDuckGo browser’s uniquely comprehensive privacy protections are used by tens of millions of people to protect their everyday online activities on <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-duckduckgo-for-mac/" rel="noopener">Mac</a>, <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/windows-browser-open-beta/" rel="noopener">Windows</a>, <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-privacy-browser-ios14/" rel="noopener">iOS</a>, and <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-app-tracking-protection/" rel="noopener">Android</a>, from searching to browsing, emailing, and more. We also offer <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/meetprivacypro/" rel="noopener">Privacy Pro</a>, a three-in-one subscription service that includes a VPN, Personal Information Removal, and Identity Theft Restoration.</em><br /><br /></p>
<p>We’re looking for a <strong>Staff Site Reliability Engineer</strong> to help shape our all-in-one privacy solution and join our mission to show the world that protecting your privacy online can be simple.  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong> </p>
<p>In this highly technical role, you'll act as a hands-on leader and engineering partner for one of our key strategic objectives (search or similar), pragmatically navigating cross-functional interests to help us execute our vision with urgency. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>You'll focus on hands-on technical work, diving deep into our stack to understand and optimize complex systems and user interactions, participate in SRE on-call rotation, triaging production issues and defining appropriate remediation, and help shape the future technical direction of our stack, all while keeping privacy at the forefront as you improve reliability and performance. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>You'll also advise engineers on the SRE team and beyond, nurturing their growth and collaborating closely with other developers throughout the end-to-end development cycle across technical design, implementation, QA, review, and release.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>What You Will Bring to DuckDuckGo</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>10+ years of experience in SRE focused roles responsible for supporting, scaling and ensuring reliability of large-scale end-to-end infrastructures.</li>

<li>Ability to root cause sources of instability of high-traffic, distributed systems.</li>
<li>Skilled at managing complex solutions and delivering in pragmatic ways.</li>
<li>Deep experience working with Linux and web technologies.</li>
<li>Experience participating in a 24x7 on-call rotation for large-scale deployment.</li>
<li>Advanced programming experience and comfort with working in multiple languages as required (please note we mainly use Perl and Go).</li>
