<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of DApps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol (a continuation of Whisper).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception.&nbsp; Our team is currently 150+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.</span></p></div>

We believe that the largest deployment of Ethereum will potentially be on embedded systems, Nimbus will be designed to perform well on embedded, mobile, and generally resource-restricted devices. The extensible, configurable, and modular design of Nimbus will make it production ready for Web 3.0 and will ensure that it can be supported and maintained across all goals of Ethereum 2.0.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building the stack from the ground up, we’re translating the latest Ethereum 2.0 research into practical, performant and reusable libraries to provide fertile exploration ground for further R&amp;D. </span><a href="https://our.status.im/nimbus-update-september-11th/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check our latest update!</span></a></p>
