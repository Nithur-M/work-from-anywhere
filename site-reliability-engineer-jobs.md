</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>What You Will Bring to DuckDuckGo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At least 7 years of engineering experience, with 5+ years focused on tackling the reliability challenges of large-scale deployments and high-traffic, distributed systems.</li>

<li>Experience with production troubleshooting, including: distributed systems, code, storage, networking, operating systems (Linux) and databases.</li>
<li>Moderate-to-advanced programming experience, preferably in a high-level language like Perl or Python.</li>
<li>Experience participating in a 24x7 on-call rotation for a large-scale deployment.</li>
<li>Effective project management skills; you have successfully launched projects from inception to production, utilizing strong communication skills and effective stakeholder management.</li>
<li>Resident in the U.S. or Canada.</li>
</ul>
