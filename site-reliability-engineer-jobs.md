&lt;p&gt;As a member of the team you will gain experience in a broad range of cloud technologies. We evolve our offerings as the state of the art improves, so you get to stay current with the latest capabilities in open source infrastructure. We drive upgrades to keep our customers on the latest, best solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Degree in Software Engineering or Computer Science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux and familiarity with Linux networking and storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python software development expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operational experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&lt;/li&gt;
