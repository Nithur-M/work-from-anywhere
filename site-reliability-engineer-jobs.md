<li>Collectively founded more than a dozen venture-backed companies.</li>
<li>More than 10 different nationalities.</li>
<li>We deeply believe in <a href="https://supabase.com/blog/2022/03/25/should-i-open-source-my-company" target="_blank">the efficacy of collaborative open source</a>. We support existing communities and tools, rather than building "yet another xx".</li>

</ul>
<h2><a id="process" class="anchor"></a>Process</h2>
<ul>
