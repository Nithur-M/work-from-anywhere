There are many ways to do that, but the easiest way to help us out is by answering the following questions:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What's your admin/coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals? <em>(We’re serious, we want to know! Share what you’re comfortable sharing, but we are a group of ambitious individuals building a community of people who want to achieve success in every aspect of our lives, and we encourage employees to figure out how they can use Expensify to realize their personal goals with the support of the company around them.)</em></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.</p></li></ol><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyway! Forward your responses to the questions to <a href="mailto:apply@expensify.com">apply@expensify.com</a>. We're excited to hear from you!</h2>
