The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 20,000 people in need (see our <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com\">6,000+ five-star reviews</a>) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We just closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 52 to 91 last year and we expect to grow again in 2024.</p><h3><strong>The Job</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Social Security disability benefits are a key feature of this country’s safety net. But when folks try to access these benefits, they find themselves pitted against the Social Security Administration — an outdated bureaucracy deadset on denying them benefits. The Direct Representation team evens the odds: we take on the SSA for our clients – and we win. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">People who success in this role are excited about: </p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Driving client relationships;</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Collaborating with attorneys on case strategy;</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Shaping evidence to win client cases;</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Working with other teams at Atticus to improve how we serve all clients; and</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Redefining what high quality representation looks like in disability proceedings.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup and gain exposure to both legal practice and business operations — and mentorship from folks who've been in your shoes. It’s designed to be a path to (a) staying at Atticus and advancing on the Direct Representation team, or (b) heading to law school or business school (we'll help you with applications and we write great recs). </p><h3><strong>Qualifications</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Required:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have 1+ years of experience succeeding in a professional role that required a substantial amount of client-facing work (like a case manager) or lawyer-facing work (like a paralegal). </p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You earned a degree from a top college or university where you demonstrated strong academic performance.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are comfortable in a variety of interpersonal conversations; you can be empathetic and kind when speaking with average people in a moment of crisis, and can be thoughtful and organized when interacting with attorneys.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are a resourceful team-player ready to dive into a scrappy startup environment where you will learn quickly and get your hands dirty.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have a demonstrated commitment to doing good and helping people.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Bonus / Nice-to-Have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have professional experience helping others apply for government benefits.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have experience at a startup or other fast-paced, agile environment. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech or law, we’d love to meet you.</p><h3><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">15 vacation days &amp; 16 paid holidays each year</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$1,000/year reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work </p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">401(k) and optional HSA</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free snacks, drinks, weekly lunches, and regular team dinners/events/retreats</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $60,000 and $85,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><h3><strong>Location</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p>","tags":"[\"legal\"]","pubDate":"2025-01-06T22:48:39.766Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/atticus/bbfe10c4-9228-494f-9f4c-83679fb6e3ff","slug":"paralegal-client-manager-atticus-2197"},{"id":7427701545,"title":"Software Engineer - Source [IC2]","company":"Sourcegraph","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3979584?s=200&v=4","description":"&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a112ff;&quot;&gt;Who we are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI.
