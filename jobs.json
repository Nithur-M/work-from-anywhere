To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.</p>\n<p>We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding developers themselves. They should be completely at home reviewing a patch or a software design spec. They are trusted engineers who understand the importance of a whole-team effort in creating great products, and who enjoy seeing colleagues develop. They should contribute code themselves to set the standard for coding, but know that the code they write is far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team’s direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills, and train engineers who are interested in soft skills to be managers.</p>\n<p>A typical first-level software engineering team is based in a single time zone such as EMEA or Americas or APAC, with an Engineering Manager and a Senior Engineer dedicated to a single product, who work as a team to shape the roadmap, technical strategy, code, documentation and community engagement. They are both capable of coding, and are both leaders comfortable assigning work and maintaining expectations of delivery. They will both be expected to take management training at Canonical so they speak the same language when it comes to team behaviours, habits, routines, norms and standards, but they focus on different sides of the problem.</p>\n<p>An Engineering Manager is responsible for line management and career guidance. The ability to develop engineering talent, to represent your team and product from a technical perspective, and to drive collaboration with other teams and customers are all critical to success in this role.</p>\n<p>We have open manager roles across a wide range of engineering domains, including:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python and Golang</li>\n<li>C / C++ / Rust</li>\n<li>Data infrastructure</li>\n<li>HTML / CSS / JavaScript / Typescript / React</li>\n<li>Flutter</li>\n<li>Distro packaging and systems</li>\n<li>SAAS and web microservices</li>\n<li>Kernel</li>\n<li>Servers</li>\n<li>Graphics, Browser and Desktop&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Silicon enablement and embedded devices</li>\n<li>Product Security</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your domain of expertise isn’t listed above, yet you feel it’s relevant to Canonical, then feel free to apply anyway.
