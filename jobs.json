This role requires a rare combination of technical acumen, strategic foresight, and leadership excellence, with the potential to create a lasting, transformative impact on Kindred’s success.<br /></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Some of the challenges you will tackle include:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Dispatch Priority:</strong> In a system without cash exchanges, Kindred requires an innovative “match” system to determine member booking priority based on factors such as home demand, similarity, and user reputation.

You are capable of mentoring and growing a world-class data science team while working collaboratively with executives and other teams to drive company-wide impact.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Are results-oriented</strong> and have a proven track record of delivering innovative, data-driven solutions that impact business performance, such as dynamic pricing models, inventory optimization, or customer segmentation.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Have excellent communication skills</strong> and can clearly articulate complex data science concepts to non-technical stakeholders. You can effectively present insights, recommendations, and technical roadmaps to executives and other teams.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Are customer-centric</strong>, with a deep understanding of how data science can enhance the user experience.

We work across the entire spectrum of cloud offerings, from Ubuntu itself to virtualisation and private cloud, Kubernetes, and the implementation of sophisticated open source solutions such as MLops platforms, data platforms and more. We are rapidly expanding the range of open source solutions we offer and deliver to customers, as we move into new industries like telco, finance, health care and media we design and develop new open source solutions to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding engineers themselves. They should feel completely at home troubleshooting technical issues and having technical presales conversations with customers. They should contribute to project delivery themselves, but know that the technical contributions they bring are far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team’s direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills and train engineers, who are interested in soft skills, to be managers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and enterprise compute. Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of ‘most software to most companies’. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of a Cloud Professional Services Manager at Canonical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Field Engineering team is our team of cloud solutions architects at Canonical, working directly with our customers, designing private and public cloud solutions fitting their workload needs.

Managers and team members also take part in presales conversations to provide technical advice during the sales process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Cloud Professional Services Manager is responsible for line management and career guidance. The ability to develop engineering talent, to represent your team from a technical perspective, and to drive collaboration with other teams and customers are all critical to success in this role.

So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These roles include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu Core and snapd software development&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Silicon software and optimisation engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hardware-centric Linux QA Engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hardware Certification Engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Robotics engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Industrial IoT software engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We&#39;re looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What your day will look like&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams.

Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are hiring Embedded / IoT Sales Representatives to expand our reach in mission-critical industries such as Automotive, Medical Devices, Industrial Systems, Robotics, and Telco, as well as consumer electronics. We are looking for candidates who are technically skilled and familiar with embedded Linux and RTOS. We are expanding in all time zones, so we can accommodate candidates from almost any country as long as they have reasonable business access to a substantial market territory in person. As we grow our teams, we will also hire Sales Team Managers and Regional Sales Directors. Please continue with this process if your goal is a management leadership position.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The server edition of Ubuntu is already very widely used in connected devices and industrial PCs. Our newer edition of Ubuntu for IoT, called Ubuntu Core, represents the state of the art in security and resilience for high-end appliances and equipment. Our customers include global brands in consumer and industrial electronics, as well as automotive and robotics. We continue to expand our range of offerings to bring our security, management, and developer experience to the smallest Linux environments and devices. We recently added a real-time Linux capability and are working towards a range of certifications for these offerings. Together, this portfolio is Linux reinvented for optimal reliability, security, developer productivity, and footprint.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a prospecting sales and strategic account development role and requires energy, ambition, and focus. To be successful, you must be comfortable positioning and selling open source, services, and software solutions to all levels of an organization, and specifically to departments that are developing embedded software and IoT devices. You should also be familiar with at least one of our priority sectors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Customers love the idea that they can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across every cloud, every class of compute, and every category of application. Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support, managed services, consulting, and training services to customers who are deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote, and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position; it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision-making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long-term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world-leading company, we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment that promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration, and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In building our sales team, we look for five things:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Teamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Energy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu is already very widely adopted, which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with brands in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement, and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgment as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete, and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate will carry an annual bookings quota within their assigned territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagement, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness, to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account strategy. They must be comfortable selling enterprise software, open source, cloud, virtualization, container technologies, and technical software solutions to senior levels of the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Location: We are growing our sales reach in all regions - EMEA, APAC, and Americas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role entails:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building and executinge a territory plan to prioritize leading security-focused brands and manufacturers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working with marketing to promote our brand and increase market awareness in prioritized accounts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Developing pipeline through outreach, prospecting, local marketing, and industry events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Closinge contracts to meet and exceed quarterly and annual bookings targets and achieve strategic objectives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Managinge customer relationships and interactions through all stages of the sales cycle&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working with IoT Field Engineers to understand customer requirements and ensure customer satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintaining accurate data and forecasts within Salesforce&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establishing productive professional relationships with key influencers and decision-makers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coordinatinge with colleagues, including support, delivery, and management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What we are looking for in you:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undergraduate degree in a technical subject&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Confidence to respectfully speak up, exchange feedback, and share ideas without hesitation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding results&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Field sales experience in embedded Linux, embedded software, or enterprise software&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of achievement of sales targets and large account wins&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passion for technology evidenced by personal projects and initiatives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The work ethic and confidence to shine alongside motivated colleagues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Appreciative of diversity, polite, and effective in a multi-cultural, multi-national organization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thoughtfulness and self-motivation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel internationally twice a year, for company events up to two weeks long&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Willingness to travel up to 50% for customer meetings and industry events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to develop and execute territory sales plans&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Detail oriented with effective follow-up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What we offer colleagues:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide.

Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of ‘most software to most companies’. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding developers themselves. They should be completely at home reviewing a patch or a software design spec. They are trusted engineers who understand the importance of a whole-team effort in creating great products, and who enjoy seeing colleagues develop. They should contribute code themselves to set the standard for coding, but know that the code they write is far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team’s direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills, and train engineers who are interested in soft skills to be managers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A typical first-level software engineering team is based in a single time zone such as EMEA or Americas or APAC, with an Engineering Manager and a Senior Engineer dedicated to a single product, who work as a team to shape the roadmap, technical strategy, code, documentation and community engagement. They are both capable of coding, and are both leaders comfortable assigning work and maintaining expectations of delivery. They will both be expected to take management training at Canonical so they speak the same language when it comes to team behaviours, habits, routines, norms and standards, but they focus on different sides of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An Engineering Manager is responsible for line management and career guidance.

We are hiring &lt;strong&gt;regional sales team managers&lt;/strong&gt; in Europe, Middle East, India, Asia, ANZ, Africa, Latin America, Central America and North America, each of whom will lead a team of five to ten enterprise sales representatives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We deliver better open source from the data center to cloud and edge. Our Linux distribution Ubuntu is now the leading platform for public cloud compute, and the favorite platform for software engineers, data scientists and AI developers. Our mission is to accelerate the adoption and quality of open source globally, and our goal is to ship the most software on the planet by cores. A tidal wave of open source innovation is the next phase of the entire enterprise software industry, and we aim to be the most compelling way to ride that wave.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our customers include Global 500 enterprises and startups. We are expanding our product range from the base operating system - Ubuntu - to full enterprise solutions in infrastructure and applications. We can deliver software defined storage, private cloud solutions, container runtime environments, as well as databases, message queues, identity, observability, analytics, machine learning and web publishing capabilities. Customers love the idea that they can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across every cloud, every class of compute and every category of application.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support, managed services, consulting and training services to customers who are deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are just over 1,000 colleagues in 70+ countries and over $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In building our sales team, we look for five things:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Teamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Energy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with the enterprises in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate will carry an annual team bookings quota within their territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagements or, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness in managing their team. They will need to coach, mentor and lead by example. Their sales representatives are expected to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account strategy. They must be comfortable selling enterprise software, open source, cloud, virtualization, container technologies and technical software solutions to senior levels of the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; We are expanding our sales organisation globally and have open sales team manager roles in every region.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What your day will look like&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and execute a territory plan to prioritize outreach and prospecting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Allocate portions of territory and accounts to sales representatives on your team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identify and prioritise new logo accounts in your territory for account-based marketing and prospecting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure that sales representatives have high quality account plans for existing accounts and priority prospects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Monitor new pipeline development by your team, through outreach, prospecting, local marketing, and industry events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support contract closure to meet and exceed quarterly and annual bookings targets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be mindful and proactive in achieving tactical and strategic objectives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with customer success to identify growth opportunities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure your team maintain accurate pipeline data and forecasts within Salesforce&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Represent the company, its solutions and software&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bachelor&#39;s level degree, preferably in engineering or computer science&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leadership and management skill&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience of open source technology and solutions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Detail oriented with effective planning, organisation and reporting skill&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in enterprise software or technology sales planning and execution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of achievement in sales targets and new account wins&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Self-discipline and motivation to be successful in a distributed team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English, as well as any language that may be appropriate for your target market&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel for customer engagements, industry events and company events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Additional skills of interest&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Specific vertical experience, in particular finance, telco, health, energy, public sector, tech&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience speaking at conferences or industry events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What we offer you&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance when shaping compensation worldwide.

They are solutions architects who like to solve customer problems through architecture, presentations and training. This role is highly focused on designing ML architectures for external customers. It is not a software development role.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is particularly suited to candidates with a technical background who are business minded and driven by commercial success. This role is on our global Field Engineering team and will work closely with enterprise sales leads. We are specifically looking for people interested in solving the most difficult problems in modern data architectures. Training LLMs on multiple K8s clusters deployed on a hybrid cloud infrastructure with GPU sharing across multiple teams? Processing 10M events in real time for financial transactions? Object detection on 10k parallel 4K video streams? These are the problems we solve day to day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Most of our colleagues work from home. We are growing teams in EMEA, Americas and APAC time zones, so can accommodate candidates from almost any country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What your day will look like&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The global Field Engineering team members are Linux and cloud solutions architects for our customers, designing private and public cloud solutions fitting their workload needs. They are the cloud consultants who work hands-on with the technologies by deploying, testing and handing over the solution to our support or managed services team at the end of a project. They are also software engineers who use Python to develop Kubernetes operators and Linux open source infrastructure-as-code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Architect cloud infrastructure solutions like Kubernetes, Kubeflow, OpenStack, and Spark&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deliver solutions either on-premise or in public cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collect customer business requirements and advise them on Ubuntu and relevant open source applications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with the company values&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deliver presentations and demonstrations of Ubuntu Pro and AI/ML capabilities to prospective and current clients&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Liaise with product teams to give them feedback on requirements to influence roadmap&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work collaboratively with your sales team to reach our common targets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Global travel up to 30% of time for internal, external events and customer meetings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undergraduate degree in a technical subject or a compelling narrative about your alternative chosen path&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in data engineering, MLOps, or big data solutions deployment&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with a relevant programming language, like Python, R, or Rust.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Confidence to respectfully speak up, exchange feedback, and share ideas without hesitation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding results&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated personal interest in continuous learning and development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Practical knowledge of Linux, virtualisation, containers and networking&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Business-minded technology thinker and problem solver&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of cloud computing concepts &amp;amp; leaders, such as Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Interest in large-scale enterprise open source - private clouds, machine learning and AI, data and analytics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Intermediate level Python programming skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passion for technology evidenced by personal projects and initiatives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The work ethic and confidence to shine alongside motivated colleagues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A dynamic person who loves to jump in new projects and interact with people&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Appreciative of diversity, polite and effective in a multi-cultural, multi-national organisation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thoughtfulness and self-motivation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Result-oriented, with a personal drive to follow up and meet commitments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel internationally, for company events up to two weeks long, and customer or industry meetings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What you’ll learn&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Architect and deploy AI/ML infrastructures, data processing pipelines and multi-cluster distributed training&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wide range of open source applications and skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work directly with customers in a range of different businesses&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Real-life and hands-on exposure to a wide range of emerging technologies and tools&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide.

Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company is founder led, profitable and growing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have created a new career path at Canonical for &lt;strong&gt;Performance Engineers&lt;/strong&gt; who bring exceptional clarity to software performance, correctness and efficiency. We are adding these roles to every engineering team at the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an open source platform, we have teams that work at every level of the software stack - from the kernel up through server and desktop applications, all the way to the web. We are adding roles with this focus in every engineering team in the company, to act as &lt;strong&gt;drivers of performance engineering skills, tools, culture and insights to our entire product range&lt;/strong&gt;. We have also created a central performance engineering team, where we will drive shared tools, dashboarding capabilities, measurement frameworks, analytical capabilities and skills. We call this career focus &#39;&lt;strong&gt;percorr&lt;/strong&gt;&#39; because we have found that the same deep insights that enable sophisticated performance measurement and design also enable teams to improve their harnesses and frameworks for correctness. Understanding not only the application, but the runtime, the compiler, and the system, all the way down to the CPU, gives an engineer the ability to think creatively and with insight about the right things to measure, and the right ways to verify correctness. We have found that performance engineers will often improve the deepest and trickiest areas of our test harnesses, and unblock their teams to test and measure previously &#39;dark&#39; aspects of their work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We also have teams that work with every major silicon vendor and cloud, with a particular emphasis on performance optimisation of the entire stack for that architecture, CPU family or hypervisor. Our goal is to ensure that Ubuntu users can select whatever platform they want for their workloads and know they have access to the very best performance and efficiency across the entire stack from kernel to codec.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If they wish, we will enable performance and correctness engineers to move between products every two years, so that they have the opportunity to raise the bar for performance in an array of products over time, and also that teams have the benefit of fresh eyes on their processes, thinking, harnesses, dashboards and code. Our performance and correctness leads are expected to be &lt;strong&gt;truly exceptional individuals, and also leaders&lt;/strong&gt; who are confident setting expectations of change, sharing insights and skills, running initiatives and programs. &lt;strong&gt;There is no way to move a meaningful codebase without also moving the people behind it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a career path for perfectionists and precision artists. Whether you have a particular language focus - C, C++, Rust, Golang, Python, Java, Flutter-Dart or others - or a particular love of the kernel or hardware or CPU instruction set, whether you see yourself as driving perceived user experience through performance or optimising the efficiency of data centers to reduce carbon footprint, this process is the best way to find a role at Canonical that speaks to your precision, rigour, insight and drive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: We have teams in every time zone, and can accommodate applications from almost any country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Nice-to-have skills we value&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Low-level CPU insights and assembly language - understanding cache, registers, vectorization, memory&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kernel performance insights - scheduling, context switching, hardware acceleration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Distributed systems performance insights - tracing, debugging&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Compiler level performance insights - profile guided optimization, inlining, assembler&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Runtime performance insights - Golang, Python, JVM, NodeJS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Database performance evaluation - plans, indexing, data modelling, tracing, monitoring&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Web browser performance insights - JS, web frameworks, tracing, CSS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Performance measurement tooling - profiling, eBPF, D-Trace, flamegraphs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Benchmarks and performance measurement tools - Phoronix Test Suite, others&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Test harnesses and capabilities in C, C++, Rust, Python, Golang, NodeJS, JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The role entails&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive software performance and correctness in a specific project&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with colleagues and community around the globe&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work on shared tools and infrastructure for performance measurement, analysis and reporting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Teach, train and develop skills in your team for performance culture and design&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strengthen test capabilities, harnesses and pipelines&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analyze systems and code to understand performance and scalability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Solve problems directly or through influence, leadership and skills development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Review code and technical designs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Mathematics or Physics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrable personal initiatives to measure and improve performance, efficiency and correctness in code&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Confidence to respectfully speak up, exchange feedback, and share ideas without hesitation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding results&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leadership and commitment to skills development and mentorship&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passion for technology evidenced by personal projects and initiatives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The work ethic and confidence to shine alongside motivated colleagues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Appreciative of diversity, polite and effective in a multi-cultural, multi-national organisation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thoughtfulness and self-motivation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel internationally twice a year, for company events up to two weeks long&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide.
