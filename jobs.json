We want Float to be the place where you have the autonomy and the opportunity to do the best work of your career. Demand for <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2010-01-01%202024-05-31&amp;q=%2Fm%2F02jv7&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external\">resource planning</a> is growing as organizations seek greater efficiencies from their global and more decentralized networks. Our goal is to build a $100M+ ARR business and be the central hub for how global Professional Services organizations match people to client work profitably. </p><p></p><h3><strong>Why Weâ€™re Hiring For This Role</strong></h3><p>We started out supporting a predominantly SMB audience who used Float as a 30-day free trial that was self-serve and purchased via credit card. Word-of-mouth and high-intent Google searches remain our strongest lead sources. As our product has matured to support scaling, global organizations, our fastest-growing segment is our Mid-Market ICP. This segment typically requires longer buying cycles, more complicated stakeholder management, and greater compliance and security needs, benefitting from a Sales-assisted buying journey. Weâ€™ve also grown our Customer Success teams to set these larger organizations up for successful onboarding and rollout. This last year, weâ€™ve been moving to orientate our revenue organization, marketing channel mix, and plans &amp; packaging around our growth momentum.</p><p>To this point, weâ€™ve been <strong>entirely self-funded</strong> and <strong>profitable every quarter</strong>. We have no board or external advisors.</p><p>For this next stage in our journey, weâ€™re seeking to move faster to meet our goal, prioritizing revenue growth and retention. Thatâ€™s where you come in.</p><p>Today, Glenn manages our Product, Revenue, People, and Operations departments. Since 2011, co-founders Glenn (CEO) and Lars (CTO) have led the business as the sole executives. Weâ€™re domiciled in the US, but our team of 56 works fully remote across 20 countries, predominately in EMEA, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Glenn is based in Melbourne, Australia, and Lars in Seattle, USA.</p><p>Weâ€™re seeking a Chief Revenue Officer to partner with Glenn. Youâ€™ll be a thought partner, help define our strategic bets, scale our organization, and most importantly, you will lead and manage revenue.
