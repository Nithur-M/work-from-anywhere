The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 20,000 people in need (see our<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com\"> <u>6,000+ five-star reviews</u></a>) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We just closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 91 to 151 last year and we expect to grow again in 2025.<br /></p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus works in an industry dominated by outdated technology that is ripe for fresh thinking: our core competitors rely on massive call centers to screen clients, antiquated CRMs to track and manage cases, and paper checks to get paid (provided they’re sent to the right address). </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Conversely, as a VC-backed tech company our product &amp; engineering department powers everything we do: from creating an engaging online experience for people in crisis to providing tools for our network lawyers as they serve our clients, Atticus relies on technology to fulfill our mission.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for Software Engineers to join our team.

We work across the entire spectrum of cloud offerings, from Ubuntu itself to virtualisation and private cloud, Kubernetes, and the implementation of sophisticated open source solutions such as MLops platforms, data platforms and more. We are rapidly expanding the range of open source solutions we offer and deliver to customers, as we move into new industries like telco, finance, health care and media we design and develop new open source solutions to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding engineers themselves. They should feel completely at home troubleshooting technical issues and having technical presales conversations with customers. They should contribute to project delivery themselves, but know that the technical contributions they bring are far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team’s direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills and train engineers, who are interested in soft skills, to be managers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and enterprise compute. Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of ‘most software to most companies’. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of a Cloud Field Engineering Manager at Canonical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Field Engineering team is our team of cloud solutions architects at Canonical, working directly with our customers, designing private and public cloud solutions fitting their workload needs. The portfolio of products includes on-premise cloud solutions such as Openstack, MicroCloud and Ceph, and solutions that could be deployed either on-premises or in public clouds such as Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Spark, PostgreSQL, etc.&amp;nbsp; The team works hands-on with the technologies by deploying, testing and handing over the solution to our support or managed services team at the end of a project. Managers and team members also take part in presales conversations to provide technical advice during the sales process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Cloud Field Engineering Manager is responsible for line management and career guidance. The ability to develop engineering talent, to represent your team from a technical perspective, and to drive collaboration with other teams and customers are all critical to success in this role.

We work across the entire spectrum of cloud offerings, from Ubuntu itself to virtualisation and private cloud, Kubernetes, and the implementation of sophisticated open source solutions such as MLops platforms, data platforms and more. We are rapidly expanding the range of open source solutions we offer and deliver to customers, as we move into new industries like telco, finance, health care and media we design and develop new open source solutions to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding engineers themselves. They should feel completely at home troubleshooting technical issues and having technical presales conversations with customers. They should contribute to project delivery themselves, but know that the technical contributions they bring are far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team’s direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills and train engineers, who are interested in soft skills, to be managers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and enterprise compute. Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of ‘most software to most companies’. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of a Cloud Professional Services Manager at Canonical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Field Engineering team is our team of cloud solutions architects at Canonical, working directly with our customers, designing private and public cloud solutions fitting their workload needs.

Managers and team members also take part in presales conversations to provide technical advice during the sales process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Cloud Professional Services Manager is responsible for line management and career guidance. The ability to develop engineering talent, to represent your team from a technical perspective, and to drive collaboration with other teams and customers are all critical to success in this role.

We want Float to be the place where you have the autonomy and opportunity to do the best work of your career.</p><h3><strong>Why we’re hiring for this role</strong></h3><p>The Senior Content Marketer plays a key role in maintaining and innovating our content channels to drive prospects and customers to Float. If content is the fuel that keeps the marketing engine running, then you are the person in charge of creating and distributing that fuel—making sure it meets the needs of our ideal customers and drives engagement, demand, and brand affinity.</p><p>Right now, our lean two-person content team is focused on driving our core content initiatives, which include quarterly live sessions, the monthly Resourceful newsletter, our always-on SEO program, and our LinkedIn presence. That’s where you come in: your support will enable us to keep these channels going and also explore new formats.</p><p>This role will build on what’s working, experiment with new ideas, and explore untapped opportunities—whether that’s video, community, conferences, podcasts, or something new altogether. With you on board, we will also be able to collaborate more closely with product marketing, and keep delivering content that stands out and drives both brand awareness and customer growth. Some people <em>might</em> say that resource management is not the most exciting of topics... we disagree!, and we think there are a lot of opportunities for us to be creative, opinionated, and unique in this space 😉</p><p>You will take ownership of key content activities, support product marketing efforts, and be a hands-on leader and driver within the content team. If you’re a strategic thinker who loves creating high-impact content and isn’t afraid to experiment, we’d love to hear from you.</p><p>Our Content Lead, Fio, explains the important role you will play within our Marketing team. <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/215474fd0d6748e093289200d8f224e6?sid=1cdac2bf-81f4-4f7b-a8f3-22a3d918dbac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external\"><strong>Watch this video</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/215474fd0d6748e093289200d8f224e6-b96f8b3709aa4f80-full-play.gif\" width=\"640px\" height=\"auto\" style=\"width:640px;height:auto;\"></p><p>You’ll be working asynchronously with a bright, dedicated team from across the globe, with a strong focus on taking complex problems and creating solutions that feel simple and intuitive for our customers.</p><h3><strong>What you’ll be responsible for</strong></h3><p>Early on, you’ll jump right into:</p><ul> <li> <strong>Own and drive our content calendar:</strong> partner with brand, content, performance, and product marketing to ensure alignment across initiatives.</li> <li> <strong>Lead our always-on SEO program:</strong> actively work on optimization opportunities and on-page improvements, and collaborate with our external agency on research, briefing, and reporting.</li> <li> <strong>Plan and develop content across our other channels:</strong> collaborate with our Content Marketer Stella on the execution of written and visual content for LinkedIn, live sessions, monthly newsletter, customer stories, and more.</li> </ul><p>Once you are a bit more settled, we expect that you will jump into the following projects:</p><ul> <li> <strong>Support product marketing:</strong> partner with Alexandria, our Senior Product Marketer, to create product-focused content for our product newsletter, new feature releases, and integrated product launch campaigns (we've got some big ones coming up 🎉).</li> <li> <strong>Maintain and improve our content production engine:</strong> ensure our content effectively supports product and performance marketing efforts. Think of content as the fuel that keeps our marketing engine running—so we can reach our target audience.</li> <li> <strong>Measure and report on performance:</strong> while not expected to be a data expert, you should be fluent in GA4 and content-relevant reporting tools to track success and iterate based on results.</li> <li> <strong>Keep key content assets up-to-date:</strong> regularly review and update long-form guides, listicles, and other content to align with new messaging and product features.</li> <li> <strong>Take on the management of one teammate:</strong> after your first 90 days, take on the people management of our awesome Content Marketer, Stella, including regular 1:1s and content planning sessions.</li> </ul><h3><strong>What you’ll need to be successful</strong></h3><p>We want you to love your work and believe that these skills will allow you to succeed in the role.

Word-of-mouth and high-intent Google searches remain our strongest lead sources. As our product has matured to support scaling, global organizations, our fastest-growing segment is our Mid-Market ICP. This segment typically requires longer buying cycles, more complicated stakeholder management, and greater compliance and security needs, benefitting from a Sales-assisted buying journey. We’ve also grown our Customer Success teams to set these larger organizations up for successful onboarding and rollout. This last year, we’ve been moving to orientate our revenue organization, marketing channel mix, and plans &amp; packaging around our growth momentum.</p><p>To this point, we’ve been <strong>entirely self-funded</strong> and <strong>profitable every quarter</strong>.

This will be our first C-suite hire who isn’t a founder.</p><p><strong>Metrics-driven growth:</strong> You’re experienced in SaaS subscription metrics and where to focus energy to grow revenue across new, expansion, and retention. You use data to deliver actionable insights that drive further investment. Our industry is moving incredibly fast - you understand that to improve requires ongoing experimentation and iteration.</p><p><strong>Marketing &amp; Sales Background:</strong> You’ve spent a good part of your career scaling Marketing and Sales organizations, acquiring a deep and nuanced understanding of the respective roles and specializations.</p><p><strong>Strong Leader:</strong> Your past direct reports will tell us, you’re an influential and effective leader and manager, leading by example, and supporting your team in their growth journeys.

We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance.

So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments.

Apply here if you are an exceptional Go, Rust, or C/C++ software engineer and want to work on next-generation open source VMM or container technology, or related open source networking and storage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Container, virtualisation and cloud infrastructure have become essentials of modern software deployments. We invest in open source related to application isolation, workload orchestration, system or OCI containers, micro service architecture or cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of projects under way at Canonical.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;RustVMM has great potential as a new hypervisor for Linux. We are building a team to work on this, with an emphasis on performance, security and operability. Work in Rust and bring your expert knowledge of VMM and related kernel networking and storage capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Docker images are easy to make and publish on Docker Hub and other registries, but the quality, consistency and security maintenance of those images is broadly very poor.

Our newer edition of Ubuntu for IoT, called Ubuntu Core, represents the state of the art in security and resilience for high-end appliances and equipment. Our customers include global brands in consumer and industrial electronics, as well as automotive and robotics. We continue to expand our range of offerings to bring our security, management, and developer experience to the smallest Linux environments and devices. We recently added a real-time Linux capability and are working towards a range of certifications for these offerings. Together, this portfolio is Linux reinvented for optimal reliability, security, developer productivity, and footprint.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a prospecting sales and strategic account development role and requires energy, ambition, and focus.

Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support, managed services, consulting, and training services to customers who are deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote, and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position; it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision-making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long-term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world-leading company, we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment that promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration, and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In building our sales team, we look for five things:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Teamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Energy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu is already very widely adopted, which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with brands in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement, and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgment as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete, and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate will carry an annual bookings quota within their assigned territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagement, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness, to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account strategy. They must be comfortable selling enterprise software, open source, cloud, virtualization, container technologies, and technical software solutions to senior levels of the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Location: We are growing our sales reach in all regions - EMEA, APAC, and Americas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role entails:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building and executinge a territory plan to prioritize leading security-focused brands and manufacturers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working with marketing to promote our brand and increase market awareness in prioritized accounts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Developing pipeline through outreach, prospecting, local marketing, and industry events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Closinge contracts to meet and exceed quarterly and annual bookings targets and achieve strategic objectives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Managinge customer relationships and interactions through all stages of the sales cycle&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working with IoT Field Engineers to understand customer requirements and ensure customer satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintaining accurate data and forecasts within Salesforce&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establishing productive professional relationships with key influencers and decision-makers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coordinatinge with colleagues, including support, delivery, and management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What we are looking for in you:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undergraduate degree in a technical subject&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Confidence to respectfully speak up, exchange feedback, and share ideas without hesitation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding results&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Field sales experience in embedded Linux, embedded software, or enterprise software&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of achievement of sales targets and large account wins&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passion for technology evidenced by personal projects and initiatives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The work ethic and confidence to shine alongside motivated colleagues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Appreciative of diversity, polite, and effective in a multi-cultural, multi-national organization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thoughtfulness and self-motivation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel internationally twice a year, for company events up to two weeks long&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Willingness to travel up to 50% for customer meetings and industry events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to develop and execute territory sales plans&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Detail oriented with effective follow-up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What we offer colleagues:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide.

Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of ‘most software to most companies’. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding developers themselves. They should be completely at home reviewing a patch or a software design spec. They are trusted engineers who understand the importance of a whole-team effort in creating great products, and who enjoy seeing colleagues develop. They should contribute code themselves to set the standard for coding, but know that the code they write is far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team’s direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills, and train engineers who are interested in soft skills to be managers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A typical first-level software engineering team is based in a single time zone such as EMEA or Americas or APAC, with an Engineering Manager and a Senior Engineer dedicated to a single product, who work as a team to shape the roadmap, technical strategy, code, documentation and community engagement. They are both capable of coding, and are both leaders comfortable assigning work and maintaining expectations of delivery. They will both be expected to take management training at Canonical so they speak the same language when it comes to team behaviours, habits, routines, norms and standards, but they focus on different sides of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An Engineering Manager is responsible for line management and career guidance.

We are just over 1,000 colleagues in 70+ countries and over $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In building our sales team, we look for five things:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Teamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Energy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with the enterprises in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate will carry an annual team bookings quota within their territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagements or, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness in managing their team. They will need to coach, mentor and lead by example. Their sales representatives are expected to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account strategy. They must be comfortable selling enterprise software, open source, cloud, virtualization, container technologies and technical software solutions to senior levels of the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; We are expanding our sales organisation globally and have open sales team manager roles in every region.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What your day will look like&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and execute a territory plan to prioritize outreach and prospecting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Allocate portions of territory and accounts to sales representatives on your team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identify and prioritise new logo accounts in your territory for account-based marketing and prospecting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure that sales representatives have high quality account plans for existing accounts and priority prospects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Monitor new pipeline development by your team, through outreach, prospecting, local marketing, and industry events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support contract closure to meet and exceed quarterly and annual bookings targets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be mindful and proactive in achieving tactical and strategic objectives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with customer success to identify growth opportunities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure your team maintain accurate pipeline data and forecasts within Salesforce&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Represent the company, its solutions and software&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bachelor&#39;s level degree, preferably in engineering or computer science&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leadership and management skill&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience of open source technology and solutions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Detail oriented with effective planning, organisation and reporting skill&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in enterprise software or technology sales planning and execution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of achievement in sales targets and new account wins&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Self-discipline and motivation to be successful in a distributed team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English, as well as any language that may be appropriate for your target market&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel for customer engagements, industry events and company events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Additional skills of interest&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Specific vertical experience, in particular finance, telco, health, energy, public sector, tech&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience speaking at conferences or industry events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What we offer you&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance when shaping compensation worldwide.

We are adding these roles to every engineering team at the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an open source platform, we have teams that work at every level of the software stack - from the kernel up through server and desktop applications, all the way to the web. We are adding roles with this focus in every engineering team in the company, to act as &lt;strong&gt;drivers of performance engineering skills, tools, culture and insights to our entire product range&lt;/strong&gt;. We have also created a central performance engineering team, where we will drive shared tools, dashboarding capabilities, measurement frameworks, analytical capabilities and skills. We call this career focus &#39;&lt;strong&gt;percorr&lt;/strong&gt;&#39; because we have found that the same deep insights that enable sophisticated performance measurement and design also enable teams to improve their harnesses and frameworks for correctness. Understanding not only the application, but the runtime, the compiler, and the system, all the way down to the CPU, gives an engineer the ability to think creatively and with insight about the right things to measure, and the right ways to verify correctness. We have found that performance engineers will often improve the deepest and trickiest areas of our test harnesses, and unblock their teams to test and measure previously &#39;dark&#39; aspects of their work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We also have teams that work with every major silicon vendor and cloud, with a particular emphasis on performance optimisation of the entire stack for that architecture, CPU family or hypervisor. Our goal is to ensure that Ubuntu users can select whatever platform they want for their workloads and know they have access to the very best performance and efficiency across the entire stack from kernel to codec.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If they wish, we will enable performance and correctness engineers to move between products every two years, so that they have the opportunity to raise the bar for performance in an array of products over time, and also that teams have the benefit of fresh eyes on their processes, thinking, harnesses, dashboards and code. Our performance and correctness leads are expected to be &lt;strong&gt;truly exceptional individuals, and also leaders&lt;/strong&gt; who are confident setting expectations of change, sharing insights and skills, running initiatives and programs. &lt;strong&gt;There is no way to move a meaningful codebase without also moving the people behind it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a career path for perfectionists and precision artists. Whether you have a particular language focus - C, C++, Rust, Golang, Python, Java, Flutter-Dart or others - or a particular love of the kernel or hardware or CPU instruction set, whether you see yourself as driving perceived user experience through performance or optimising the efficiency of data centers to reduce carbon footprint, this process is the best way to find a role at Canonical that speaks to your precision, rigour, insight and drive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: We have teams in every time zone, and can accommodate applications from almost any country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Nice-to-have skills we value&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Low-level CPU insights and assembly language - understanding cache, registers, vectorization, memory&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kernel performance insights - scheduling, context switching, hardware acceleration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Distributed systems performance insights - tracing, debugging&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Compiler level performance insights - profile guided optimization, inlining, assembler&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Runtime performance insights - Golang, Python, JVM, NodeJS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Database performance evaluation - plans, indexing, data modelling, tracing, monitoring&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Web browser performance insights - JS, web frameworks, tracing, CSS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Performance measurement tooling - profiling, eBPF, D-Trace, flamegraphs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Benchmarks and performance measurement tools - Phoronix Test Suite, others&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Test harnesses and capabilities in C, C++, Rust, Python, Golang, NodeJS, JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The role entails&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive software performance and correctness in a specific project&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with colleagues and community around the globe&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work on shared tools and infrastructure for performance measurement, analysis and reporting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Teach, train and develop skills in your team for performance culture and design&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strengthen test capabilities, harnesses and pipelines&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analyze systems and code to understand performance and scalability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Solve problems directly or through influence, leadership and skills development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Review code and technical designs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Mathematics or Physics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrable personal initiatives to measure and improve performance, efficiency and correctness in code&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Confidence to respectfully speak up, exchange feedback, and share ideas without hesitation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding results&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leadership and commitment to skills development and mentorship&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passion for technology evidenced by personal projects and initiatives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The work ethic and confidence to shine alongside motivated colleagues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Appreciative of diversity, polite and effective in a multi-cultural, multi-national organisation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thoughtfulness and self-motivation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel internationally twice a year, for company events up to two weeks long&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide.

Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers.

We help creators grow and monetize their audience with ease. For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn’t a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products - all within one platform. More importantly, there isn’t a team more committed to helping creators earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform. We have always been 100% independent and 100% remote. We are proud to have built a product that our customers love, and we look for people who have enthusiasm and belief in our mission, vision, and values to join our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Kit culture is one where emotional intelligence is valued, radical candor is encouraged, and where everyone works together to uphold a set of shared team principles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the Executive Assistant to the CEO, you will be a strategic partner in ensuring smooth operations, effective communication, and high-impact execution across the company. This role extends far beyond traditional administrative support—you’ll be a force multiplier for the CEO, driving efficiency, maximizing opportunities, and keeping high-priority initiatives moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The CEO is highly ambitious, constantly advancing multiple initiatives at once. We’re looking for someone who thrives in this dynamic environment—someone energized, not intimidated, by a leader who pushes to do all the things. You should be excited by the challenge of keeping up, anticipating needs, and ensuring seamless execution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll report directly to the CEO and collaborate closely with teams across sales, marketing, product, and operations. Given the CEO’s high expectations around turnaround times, follow-ups, and project deadlines, this role often involves moving things across the finish line outside of core working hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Success in this role requires adaptability, problem-solving, and strategic thinking in a fast-paced, ever-evolving environment. With many competing priorities, the right candidate will embrace AI and automation to enhance systems, optimize workflows, and ensure&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; gets done—efficiently and on time. Additionally, this role includes support with personal tasks, requiring a high level of discretion and trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re someone who sees complexity as an opportunity, thrives on pace and impact, and is eager to leverage technology to drive execution, we’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Work:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the Executive Assistant to the CEO, you will:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage high-priority projects by conducting research, preparing compelling pitches, and securing executive buy-in.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own the CEO’s email, calendar, and priorities, ensuring fast follow-up on sales leads, investor inquiries, and strategic partnerships.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain systems for organization, outreach, and follow-up, maximizing opportunities from the CEO’s inbox and social media channels.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support executive collaboration by prepping board updates, pulling relevant data, and proactively surfacing key conversations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proactively engage with key contacts, partners, and opportunities to keep the CEO ahead of critical relationships and initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create content that aligns with Kit’s brand guidelines, working with Kit’s marketing leaders to support the CEO’s external presence.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use AI and automation tools to optimize workflows, improving efficiency and freeing up time for strategic work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Balance short-term tactical execution with long-term strategic planning, ensuring the CEO’s focus remains on high-impact priorities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Act as a gatekeeper and problem solver, anticipating challenges and removing roadblocks before they escalate.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Travel with the CEO to events to optimize his time and enhance engagement with customers and potential partners.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in high-intensity, fast-paced environments—for example, investment banking, management consulting, Hollywood talent agencies, or supporting a high-profile executive.

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 20,000 people in need (see our <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com\">12,000+ five-star reviews</a>) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We just closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 52 to 91 last year and we expect to grow again in 2024.</p><h3><strong>The Job</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To provide a great experience for a client, we have to do a lot quickly: Understand their situation, identify their needs, give advice, match them with the right lawyer, connect them to that lawyer, convince both parties to work together, and formalize the arrangement — all while doing our best to make a complex and scary system feel simple, accessible, and human. We’ve managed to do all of this in a way that users love, but we’ve done it by leaving some parts of the process quite manual... which means we can only scale so far.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your job is to change that: to lead the effort to transform our product into a platform that can serve millions of people. We’ve structured this role to provide meaningful ownership of our lawyer-facing and internal products, as well as exposure to all of our client-facing products. You'll craft a strategic plan and roadmap, then coordinate our teams — design, engineering, and client service — to implement it. You’ll own key metrics and outcomes, and get to think holistically about how to achieve them. The role mixes strategy, data analysis, product design, and a lot of people management. It's a hard job, with huge potential for impact, promotion, and building a team.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You will be tasked with owning, maintaining, and expanding our core products. We are looking for someone with a unique combination of strategic prowess and operational acumen to drive this. An ideal candidate is a self-motivated, independent problem solver who is excited to ask questions, dive into the details, make recommendations, and drive results. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You will work with our<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-behr-a9a5948/\"> COO</a> &amp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-abrahams-443a4366/\"> Director of Product</a>, but work across many teams (including the lawyer network, engineering, business operations) to adapt and develop solutions to stakeholder problems.

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 30,000 people in need (see our <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com\"><u>12,000+ five-star reviews</u></a>) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 91 to over 150 last year and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><h3><strong>The Job</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our business is complex and multi-faceted: We play in an enormous space with huge barriers to entry, we have no direct competitors, and as a two-sided marketplace we have to coordinate multiple constituencies via a complex funnel with some parts that are all tech and others that are fully human. Every day we face new operating challenges that require someone to quickly gather data, make a decision, and execute.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">So, in addition to software engineers, lawyers, and marketers, our team includes a bunch of ex-consultants (our CEO is a BCG alum and we’ve built a 3-person BizOps org from BCG and McKinsey). To a level that’s unusual among our peer startups, we’re investing in building a top-tier Strategy &amp; Business Operations team that oversees the core of our business and drives key projects, and we’re hiring several more consultants to join it.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This job mixes things in any good consultant’s comfort zone (devising strategy, managing and coordinating projects, gathering and analyzing data) with responsibilities unique to being an operator in a fast-growing tech company (user research, product development, growth marketing, venture finance). In a typical week you might do any of the following:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Partner with marketing to understand which acquisitions channels have the highest ROI  — and research the market to find other, similar channels and test them at Atticus.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Develop the conceptual framework we’ll use to match clients to the best law firm in our network available (for their case, geography, client and firm preferences, etc.) and work with the data science team to turn it into a reality.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Interview 20 partner law firms to prioritize the next set of features we’ll build, then partner with Design and Product to craft a formal roadmap and mock up wireframes for our next product launch.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup in a position that mixes strategy and execution, includes mentorship from people who have been in your shoes, and gives a deep exposure to startup finance and operations. It’s designed to be a path to (a) staying here and growing as an executive (including the chance to specialize as a functional lead <em>outside of BizOps</em>), (b) heading to grad school, or (c) or starting your own company down the road.</p><h3><strong>Qualifications</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Required:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You were/are at a top consulting firm and have been promoted at least once.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve led projects where you mapped complex systems, gathered and analyzed data, made recommendations, and helped design and implement solutions.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re a kind and thoughtful colleague who knows how to shape a great team culture, persuasively advocate for your ideas, and get buy-in from others.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have a demonstrated commitment to doing good and helping people.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Bonus / Nice-to-Have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have experience with marketplace businesses or complex consumer services (insurance, fintech, medical, real estate, etc.).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve done consumer-focused research or discovery work, or something else that makes you comfortable interviewing and empathizing with people from all walks of life.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.</p><h3><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">15 vacation days &amp; ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Student loan repayment assistance, 401(k), and optional HSA</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free snacks, drinks, weekly lunches, and regular team dinners/events/retreats</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $130,000 to $160,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><h3><strong>Location</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, about half our team are in Los Angeles or New York City (where we have offices) and half are fully remote and spread across the U.S. There are two options for this job:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Live in Los Angeles, work a few days a week (or more) out of our beautiful office in Chinatown.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between monthly and quarterly.</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In short: You can do this job well remotely, and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. But we care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p>","tags":"[\"finance\",\"legal\"]","pubDate":"2025-02-07T22:49:10.446Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/atticus/37661fa1-aef8-4cb3-854d-7bc5e8e7fc3d","slug":"business-operations-lead-atticus-5960"},{"id":6941885053,"title":"Mid/Senior Product Manager","company":"Synthflow","image":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1879924055165272064/o-V7OZKb_400x400.jpg","description":"<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>About Synthflow AI:</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Synthflow AI is an innovative, high-growth generative AI startup redefining how businesses interact with their customers.
