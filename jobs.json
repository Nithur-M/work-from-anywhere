the world's first unified payment infrastructure, empowering businesses worldwide to unleash their payment potential. By choosing our platform, merchants can take control over their payment stack, create unique commerce experiences, accelerate their roadmap and increase payment success.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Primer's enterprise-grade infrastructure, frameworks, and tooling allow merchants to unify their disparate payment solutions and services to build optimised payment flows tailored to their unique business needs with no code or additional complexity.

You will be working across a number of different teams as a Navy Seal deployed to drive massive gains in conversion rates and performance. We want someone who can think big picture and look at the entire customer journey and then parachute down and take a microscope to help the teams find small areas of optimization and improvement in those micro-experiences. You are a facilitator and multiplier on any team’s success you’re deployed to by helping design impactful experiments to learn and push performance to new heights. Some people love to build new products and channels, you love tweaking, refining, and optimizing that work to 10x or even 100x outcomes at scale.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You sweat the small details because you know that nudging a few pixels to the right or the left or rewording a headline can be the difference between a massive win and a flat result. You understand the importance of testing and iteration velocity and that while the job is never finished, you also have a good sense of when the low hanging fruit has been captured and it’s time to move on to the next area of optimization. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, you aren’t a rogue cowboy, rather you are a masterful collaborator and orchestrator - you can bring disparate teams together to solve higher-order business problems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What you&#39;ll be doing&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deployed by senior leadership to work on some of the highest-leverage parts of the business to drive meaningful and measurable improvements in short but focused bursts of extreme focus and attention&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work cross-functionally with different parts of the organization to ideate, prioritize, design, run, and measure experiments and implement the learnings for successive cycles of improvements&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Elevate the caliber of everyone’s work to drive results: the copy we use in key assets like our homepage and ads, the clarity and compellingness of our calls to action, the design of key pages and product areas, remove unnecessary friction and steps from key prospect and user journeys, etc. – all with the goal of moving the needle to drive end-to-end conversion rates up&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Circle’s evangelist and in-house expert for experimentation and growth best practices: from creating hypotheses to interpreting results to implementing learnings – you are not only an expert in your domain, but you are a passionate educator who can get the whole company on board&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What you&#39;ll need to be successful&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong alignment with our values, &lt;a href=&quot;https://circle.so/careers&quot;&gt;find our values on our career page&lt;/a&gt; if you haven’t read up on them yet&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/&quot;&gt;CEFR Level C2&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govtilr.org/&quot;&gt;ILR Level 5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong track record of moving the needle - you have done this before, at scale, and have consistently delivered big wins and run large experimental, growth, or optimization programs in the past&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Expert in experimental methodology with a very strong grasp of statistics and first-principles thinking to develop excellent hypotheses and design airtight experiments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You think holistically about the funnel and identify and measure for tradeoffs between different steps in a customer journey&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You think in frameworks and funnels - very structured thinker who can communicate and articulate nuanced ideas clearly, simply, and elegantly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sharp eye for detail both in design and copy elements and can work with and coach copywriters and designers to help take their work to the next level&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to context switch: in the morning you could be working on ad copy and in the afternoon working on an in-product checkout experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No one excels at all digital marketing channels and product areas — so tell us which ones you’re most confident in or passionate about, and we’ll help build the growth strategy around your skills and interests&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Must be a strong internal operator who bring diverse people together to solve a common problem&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Project management skills are a must: you’re covering a lot of ground across a variety of concurrent experiments, so you’ll need to be very organized and efficient&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;$160,000 - $180,000 USD per year&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cash compensation range shown is a starting point.
