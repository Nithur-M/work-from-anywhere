The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 70,000 people in need (see our <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com\">6,000+ five-star reviews</a>) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We just closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 52 to 91 last year and we expect to grow again in 2024.<br /></p><h3><strong>The Job</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To provide a great experience for a client, we have to do a lot quickly: Understand their situation, identify their needs, give advice, match them with the right lawyer, connect them to that lawyer, convince both parties to work together, and formalize the arrangement — all while doing our best to make a complex and scary system feel simple, accessible, and human. We’ve managed to do all of this in a way that users love, but we’ve done it by leaving some parts of the process quite manual... which means we can only scale so far.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your job is to change that: to lead the effort to transform our product into a platform that can serve millions of people. You'll craft a strategic plan and roadmap that will enable our tech stack to scale 10x in volume we currently support and plant the seeds for 20x. The role mixes engineering strategy, architectural decisions, and people management. You will focus on leading a cross-functional team focused on building a highly performant, intuitive and secure client experience on the web for Atticus clients, lawyers, and our internal teams.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You will work with our <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethicsmatters/\">VP of Engineering</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-behr-a9a5948/\">COO</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-abrahams-443a4366/\">Director of Product</a> but work across many teams (including product, design, lawyer network, as well as client experience and marketing). </p><h3><strong>What You'll Do</strong></h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Help your team design, build and operate Atticus’ APIs with a focus on performance and reliability</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Plan roadmaps 3-6 months ahead but are deeply engaged on week to week operations. </p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Evaluate storage technologies and methodologies with an eye toward scalability and performance</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Architect, design, review, and test code in a collaborative environment with other software engineers.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Leverage your team as multipliers for your skills to create excellent products and services</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Train other technical leaders on the team to do as you do.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>What You Need</strong></h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You've been the best engineer in the room before and you know how to get others there.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You've led engineering teams with success on highly critical products.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve been leading engineering teams for 5+ years.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You love fostering career growth and building a strong team culture.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You care deeply about operational excellence (incident management, resilient systems, high availability, etc.)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You proactively identify problems and opportunities and generate creative approaches to solve them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You're a champion of end user products and passionately collaborate with product and design.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team.

Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">15 vacation days &amp; 16 paid holidays each year</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$1,000/year reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work </p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">401(k) and optional HSA</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free snacks, drinks, weekly lunches, and regular team dinners/events/retreats</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Location</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p>","tags":"[\"management\",\"engineering\",\"legal\"]","pubDate":"2025-03-03T23:36:01.439Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/atticus/ed72d915-75a3-4769-830c-1538b45cbf94","slug":"staff-engineer-atticus-7587"},{"id":7004960447,"title":"People Operations Specialist [IC1 - IC2]","company":"Sourcegraph","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3979584?s=200&v=4","description":"&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who we are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI.
