We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Recruiting, Finance, Security, Sales, and Marketing. The company was founded in 2011 and received investment from top-tier investors including Y Combinator and Mark Cuban. We're a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding.</p>\n<p>As a Data Center Technician, you will be responsible for the installation and maintenance of our data center infrastructure in Dallas. You will work closely with our team to manage installation of new servers and networking gear as well as maintenance and upgrades as needed. We'll expect familiarity with server hardware, including replacing components and troubleshooting hardware failures. We'll expect familiarity with network switch configuration, network design, and a working understanding of OSI layers 1 through 3. We appreciate meticulous care to tidy cabling and labeling. Linux experience is desired. Must be able to lift and install heavy server equipment safely.</p>\n<p>The ideal candidate will have experience and passion for tinkering with computers and consider it a hobby instead of just a job. Strong analytical skills are essential for diagnosing and resolving technical issues quickly and efficiently. Excellent verbal and written communication skills are required to document infrastructure and collaborate with team members effectively.</p>\n<p>Junior candidates are welcome to apply as long as you're excited to learn. We can provide training. Senior candidates are also welcome to apply and your experience can be beneficial beyond the scope of this single data center.</p>\n<p>The position will initially not have enough responsibilities to accommodate a full-time position, so we're looking for part-time candidates. We're planning to move in to the new site in late September and will have plenty of work for the first several weeks. Following that, the workload will reduce to occasional maintenance and upgrades. From our experience operating other data centers, it's rare that we have time-sensitive maintenance work, so this job comes with a high degree of flexibility. We expect that you'll have other obligations and can be respectful about timing of work to accommodate other part or full-time jobs or school. Our team is highly competent, experienced, and will be easy to work with.
