This is a competitive space, and Product Marketing’s role to define our product narrative and deliver crisp content is critical to our success. If you’re interested in working in the intersection of generative AI, dev tools, and Marketing (messaging, storytelling, and sales enablement), then this role is for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this role, you’ll work collaboratively with Marketing, Product, Engineering, and Sales teams.You will be a key content creator with an emphasis on all things technical. You will be a key content creator within the Marketing team and focus deeply on individual devs and our enterprise customers. You will create technical blogs, whitepapers, reports, and slide decks for marketing and sales support. You will also craft demo flows, talk tracks, and live content that highlight our product’s strengths and lean into trends and use cases for devs and generative AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will help us tell more stories about how customers use our products and own analyst relations for Sourcegraph. You’ll establish a tight feedback loop between Sales, Product, and Marketing. Your understanding of our products and the feedback of our customers will inform our marketing strategy and the content we create in the generative AI space.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While we’re a small company and ownership and priorities change often, these are the main areas you’ll be responsible for:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Technical product content (videos &amp;amp; written content)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Product-specific support:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bi-weekly &amp;amp; monthly release GTM&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cody&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Amp (shared)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead analyst relations&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support customer marketing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Product-led growth (shared)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Content &amp;amp; thought leadership (shared)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role has lots of potential to deepen our company’s understanding of generative AI and our brand in the space. This person will be strategic in how they help build our product narrative. This role will also be tactical, and we will look to this PMM to help us move quickly and create content to help grow developers’ love for and awareness of Cody every week, particularly among the enterprise segment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;📅 Within one month, you will…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Become an expert on our product, including its strengths and limitations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take over analyst relations, maintaining relationships with industry experts across top firms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Begin researching new use cases for AI in the developer ecosystem, including through customer calls, to bring new insights back to the Marketing team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;📅 Within three months, you will…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Regularly join customer calls and calls with the Sales team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Report learnings and insights back to the Marketing team in weekly team check-ins.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Publish several deeply technical blog posts that unpack use cases and best practices for using generative AI for code.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support our Product team with key launch moments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the website (sourcegraph.com), and work with the rest of the Product Marketing team to build out new webpages using your learnings on product use cases.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;📅 Within six months, you will…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build out content for, and present in, webinars for our prospects.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deliver best practices resources to the Sales and Customer Engineering teams. For example, this could be a whitepaper outlining where and when Cody or Amp is best used for different languages and common development tasks (such as code modernization or unit testing).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;📅 Within one year, you will…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish a formal feedback loop process between Sales, Marketing, and Product teams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consistently deliver high-quality technical content materials that delight developers and speak to an enterprise audience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create and maintain a demo flow and talk track for Cody that is commonly used by sellers in the field and marketers at trade shows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About you&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You have a technical background and a passion for working with customers and understanding the go-to-market strategy side of a business. You also have a strong interest in generative AI and its applications and are excited to do research in the area. You’re a natural storyteller with strong communication skills and an interest in B2B technology or dev tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Must haves:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You enjoy writing and consider yourself a strong writer. Much of the work of product marketers involves communicating ideas effectively in writing, so this skill is critical to the PMM role.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have some experience with code and building apps. You use AI coding assistants yourself and know the landscape and have your favorites. This could be writing code professionally, or familiarity through schoolwork or as a hobby.&amp;nbsp; Our products are all about making developers’ lives easier as they write code, so a basic understanding of code will be critical to your product expertise and empathy for developers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’re excited about a high-agency role. A lot of this role will be work that is done for the first time (for example, interviewing customers and sellers to compile research on new use cases for generative AI). There is &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of room for high-agency, strategic thinking, and creative approaches in this role.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ve worked in an environment with a product-led growth model.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’re ready to roll up your sleeves and do both strategic and tactical work. As the PMM in this role, you will do research and help with narrative storytelling, but you’ll spend even more time writing content, getting on calls with customers, and occasionally running webinars. Everyone on Sourcegraph’s marketing team gets hands-on with building content, all the way up to the CMO!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nice-to-haves:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have 5-7&amp;nbsp; years of work experience in technical marketing or another customer-facing role, ideally at a company building dev tools. In this role, you’ll take the initiative to work with different people across our business as well as customers, and having some prior work experience in a similar corporate or startup environment will give you a headstart.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have a CSS background and you’ve worked in B2B SaaS or a dev tools company, or have experience working on a product for developers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ve built technical content or collateral to support a sales team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’re excited to work in a startup. Our product is always evolving, and so does our work and our priorities. We stay nimble as we try new things to grow the business.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;📊 This job is an IC3 - IC4.&amp;nbsp; You can read more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Leveling-Guide-0e1b5c76ada64b9caac387f8b7c4fc66&quot;&gt;our job leveling philosophy&lt;/a&gt; in our Handbook.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💸 We pay you an above-average salary&lt;/strong&gt; because we want to hire the best people who are fully focused on helping Sourcegraph succeed, not worried about paying bills.
