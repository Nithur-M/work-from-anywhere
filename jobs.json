Answering a simple question like <em>“Who are the biggest Ethereum token holders over time?”</em> requires an engineering team to run their own RPC nodes, ingest the full history of the blockchain, clean the data, transform the data and finally summon a wizard to cast a complex SQL query.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Accessing data is hard because blockchains are optimized for Writes and not Reads</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Why is it so hard? Blockchains have historically been optimized for Writes (getting data onto the blockchain) and less for Reads (getting data OUT of the blockchain). This is because optimization efforts were focused on increasing transaction throughput and building fault tolerant and scalable consensus algorithms. This neglect makes it hard to get data out efficiently and reliably at scale.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Parsing and interpreting blockchain data requires both deep domain expertise and data manipulation</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">To quote Tim Roughgarden, Columbia Professor, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tim_Roughgarden/status/1512847113599729668\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>“Blockchains are (virtual) computers, not databases.”</u></em></a>  They are Turing machines that support general computations, and anyone can write and deploy their own smart contract for their own use case. This nearly infinite number of use cases leads to the fragmentation of data schemas for different purposes. Standardizing these schemas requires deep domain expertise to turn esoteric technical outputs into clear information for specific concepts like tokens, NFTs, stablecoins and DEXs.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Allium abstracts the complexity with a simple way to query blockchain data</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Allium tames the chaos by ingesting, sanitizing, and standardizing all this data. As of this post, the data we’ve archived across 40+ blockchains is in the petabytes and growing exponentially.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Google and Bloomberg had to organize the world's public financial and webpage data, Allium is on a mission to do the same for blockchain data</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">This is one of the rare times in history where indexing a giant public dataset is sorely needed by all - similar to what Bloomberg did for financial data and what Google organized for public webpage data. With this indexed data, we are fortunate to support trailblazers in this industry and play some role the industry’s most exciting trends:</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">About our customers</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We serve 2 groups of customers today with the same data but different platform. <strong>Analysts</strong> who need to answer data questions about the blockchain (think BI) and <strong>Engineers</strong> who need highly reliable data queryable in near realtime (think Application backends).

the values we strive for at Allium:</div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Pro Athlete Mindset</strong> - Consistency. Day in and day out, in pursuit of excellence. A win yesterday does not guarantee (or even imply!) a win tomorrow. I hope anyone who supports a failing sports team will feel the pain (<em>cough Man United fan</em>s) of inconsistency</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Figure It Out &amp; Extreme Ownership</strong> - Every day is unexplored territory. There are new engineering frameworks, new legal docs, new compliance, new sales, new regulations, and new operational procedures every single day. If you don’t know it, learn it. If you can’t learn it, find someone or a product that does it. If you can’t find someone, find someone who can find someone.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>High Agency</strong> - (One of) the highest commonality between all successful people is their responsiveness, most successful billionaire CEOs still reply to emails within minutes (within working hours). And when you reply, respond fast with effective solutions - and even better, resolutions. If you’re looking for a superpower, you can’t go wrong with responsiveness. Well of course this doesn't make sense when you're an engineer coding in flow, but in general high agency of problem solving gets one very far in life</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Leading from the Front </strong>- No one is going to listen (and adopt) your suggestion unless you lead by example. It’s one thing to say <em>We need to do XYZ this better </em>&amp; it’s another thing to build an MVP and say <em>“This is the way we should do things”. </em>The proof of work and momentum goes a long way.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Strong Opinions On the Future (loosely held) </strong>It is okay to be wrong, but what is not okay is not to have an idea of how a better future should be. Alliumites take pride in trying to improving everything about the company all the time.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Sense of (allium) business smell</strong> - There are number of folks who live to eat at Allium, but the Allium smell we are talking about is that we love folks who naturally want to know why and how the work they are doing builds leverage for their teammates and also relates to the business goals</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">About the team</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We invite people of all backgrounds (<a href=\"https://www.allium.so/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.allium.so/about</a>).
