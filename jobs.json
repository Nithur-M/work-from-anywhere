The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In the next two years, we aim to help over 250,000 Americans get access to life changing benefits across Disability, Worker's Comp and Personal Injury cases. To make that happen, hiring is the most important thing we’ll need to do right.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To that end, we’re hiring a Recruiter to scale up our hiring efforts for engineering, design, product and marketing. You’ll be in the driver seat to architect a pipeline, work with hiring managers, and generally drive our efforts to find, attract, and convert great people. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>What makes this role easy:</strong> We care deeply about hiring (and culture) and will give you tools and support you need to keep growing the company. Our strong social mission, rapid growth, and deep pockets mean we punch above our weight on attracting and converting talent. Our team is diverse, driven and all-around awesome (ex-Honey, Dave, Headspace, Google, McKinsey, Stanford, UChicago, etc., and really thoughtful, kind, committed people).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>What makes this role hard:</strong> We have a high bar for talent and focus largely on attracting and converting passive candidates. As we enter the post-Series C landscape, we are ramping up our hiring across our teams. For some hires we'll be building out that team for the first time, requiring close partnership with hiring managers to find the right profile. We don’t yet have a ton of employer brand recognition, and only basic hiring processes in place (e.g., Ashby is in place, some templates) – so there is still a lot of room to build.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The expectation is that in five years you’ll be able to look around the company and see hundreds of people who wouldn’t be here without you, and know that your work has touched the lives of millions of people in need.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Required:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve had demonstrated success hiring top-tier talent (scoping roles, creating processes, sourcing, screening, selling, scheduling) for 2+ years at a start-up with a high bar for people.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve led hiring for technical roles (e.g., engineering, design, product) and/or non-technical ones, and feel comfortable learning new fields quickly. You can build personal connections with all kinds of candidates and sell jobs of all stripes.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve had real and quantifiable success hiring great candidates with varying backgrounds and can speak to the strategies you’ll use to build a diverse pipeline.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have a demonstrated commitment to doing good and helping people.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">15 vacation days &amp; ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">401(k) and optional HSA/FSA</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $90,000 and $120,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p>","tags":"[\"legal\"]","pubDate":"2025-05-23T21:19:21.050Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/atticus/5239ca7a-bb2c-4113-a357-cb6bc8c8b496","slug":"recruiter-atticus-7736"},{"id":2663601181,"title":"Support Engineer","company":"Sardine","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65879301?s=200&v=4","description":"<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Who we are:</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are a leader in fraud prevention and AML compliance.

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In the next two years, we aim to help over 250,000 Americans get access to life changing benefits across Disability, Worker's Comp and Personal Injury cases. To make that happen, hiring is the most important thing we’ll need to do right.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To that end, we’re hiring a Recruiter to scale up our hiring efforts for engineering, design, product and marketing. You’ll be in the driver seat to architect a pipeline, work with hiring managers, and generally drive our efforts to find, attract, and convert great people. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>What makes this role easy:</strong> We care deeply about hiring (and culture) and will give you tools and support you need to keep growing the company. Our strong social mission, rapid growth, and funding mean we punch above our weight on attracting and converting talent. Our team is diverse, driven and all-around awesome (ex-Honey, Dave, Headspace, Google, McKinsey, Stanford, UChicago, etc., and really thoughtful, kind, committed people).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>What makes this role hard:</strong> We have a high bar for talent and focus largely on attracting and converting passive candidates. As we enter the post-Series C landscape, we are ramping up our hiring across our teams. For some hires we'll be building out that team for the first time, requiring close partnership with hiring managers to find the right profile. We don’t yet have a ton of employer brand recognition, and basic hiring processes in place (e.g., we have Ashby with basic workflows, and some templates) – so there is still a lot of room to build.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The expectation is that in five years you’ll be able to look around the company and see hundreds of people who wouldn’t be here without you, and know that your work has touched the lives of millions of people in need.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Required:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve had demonstrated success hiring top-tier talent (scoping roles, creating processes, sourcing, screening, selling, scheduling) for 2+ years at a Series A/B/C start-up with a high bar for people.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve led hiring for technical roles (e.g., engineering, design, product) and non-technical ones, and feel comfortable learning new fields quickly. You can build personal connections with all kinds of candidates and sell jobs of all stripes.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve had real and quantifiable success hiring great candidates with varying backgrounds and can speak to the strategies you’ll use to build a diverse pipeline.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have a demonstrated commitment to doing good and helping people.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">15 vacation days &amp; ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">401(k) and optional HSA/FSA</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $90,000 and $130,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p>","tags":"[\"legal\"]","pubDate":"2025-05-23T15:39:23.782Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/atticus/860ec81e-d9db-4ac7-bb33-565bc42802eb","slug":"recruiter-atticus-6710"},{"id":1861592122,"title":"Senior Software Engineer","company":"Kit","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10557747?s=200&v=4","description":"&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Description&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kit.com/&quot;&gt;Kit &lt;/a&gt;is an email-first operating system for creators who mean business.
