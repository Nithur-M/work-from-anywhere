Our goal is to make developers orders of magnitude more efficient by becoming the operating system for modern development.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We give developers a sandbox to espouse their ideas. We are looking for someone who can let them know what is possible with the platform. We seek to make developers 100x more effective, and build 100x more impactful systems.
