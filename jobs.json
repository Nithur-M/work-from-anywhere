We seek exceptional individuals around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn, create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don&#39;t track hours, but we do manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones, are highly async, and like to document a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey, Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still more to come!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About the role&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have over 12k paying communities powered by Circle, and that number is growing significantly month-over-month. Our Circle Plus customer base in particular is growing incredibly fast and our highest tier plan.

Alongside the more advanced product functionality, these customers unlock a higher service tier which gives us an opportunity to partner together more closely on their journey with Circle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Customer Success Manager, you&#39;ll be helping not only serve as a main point of contact for our Circle Plus customers, but will also have the opportunity to help us define the CS function, test &amp;amp; build new processes and work with us to design a team that delivers value consistently. Note, our Circle Plus customers are those that are subscribed to a Circle Plus plan, but can include small and medium-sized businesses, as well at truly enterprise scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll support customers in effectively rolling out Circle, ensure they’ve adopted all relevant functionality, and are continuously gaining value from our products. You’ll work to proactively identify opportunities to solve needs for our customers, and will partner closely with internal teams to engage 1:1 with customers during key moments in their lifecycle. As their primary point of contact and trusted partner, you’ll have responsibility of serving them through their entire lifecycle from onboarding through their renewal. Equipped with the knowledge of what it takes for customers to succeed with Circle, you will serve as the voice of your customers cross-functionally, providing feedback to the Product team and broader business.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have a strong preference for candidates based between the approximate time zones of Eastern time (UTC-5) and Central European time (UTC+1) to best align with our customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What you&#39;ll be doing&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ll be passionate about building relationships, helping our customers succeed in building an engaging community, and establishing yourself as a trusted advisor along their journey.

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We hire smart lawyers and set them loose on hard problems — most of which have nothing to do with traditional legal practice.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This job mixes responsibilities in any good lawyer’s comfort zone (managing and coordinating clients and cases; conducting thoughtful legal analysis; advocating for your informed perspective) with those unique to being an operator in a fast-growing tech company (user research, product development, venture finance). </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In a typical week, you might do any of the following:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Develop the conceptual framework we’ll use to match clients to the best law firm in our network available (for their case, geography, client and firm preferences, etc.) and work with the data science team to turn it into a reality.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Interview 20 partner law firms to prioritize the next set of features we’ll build, then partner with Design and Product to craft a formal roadmap and mock up wireframes for our next product launch.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Partner with marketing to scope and execute a project to collect client testimonials — develop the client profile, select the right clients, draft a client pitch, and interview our clients.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Over the last three years, we’ve attracted lawyers from firms Cravath, Wachtell, Munger Tolles, Hueston Hennigan, Boies Schiller, and Gunderson Dettmer — and schools like Stanford, Harvard, and Yale. Most have been promoted once or twice already and play critical roles across all functions.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This role is a unique opportunity to do meaningful social impact work as an attorney in a rapidly scaling startup where we put a premium on work-life balance. Your path from here could include growing as a leader at Atticus or transitioning further into tech/business as a founder or executive.</p><h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Required:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You excelled at a top law firm or non-profit, but you’re now looking to pivot away from traditional legal practice.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are a resourceful team player ready to dive into a scrappy startup environment where you will learn quickly and get your hands dirty.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have a demonstrated commitment to doing good and helping people.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have a degree from a top law school where you demonstrated strong academic performance.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are admitted to the bar in any state.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Bonus / Nice-to-Have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have several years of meaningful work experience prior to attending law school, especially in client service or business environments.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have experience at a startup or other fast-paced, agile environment. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.</p><h2><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">15 vacation days &amp; ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">401(k) and optional HSA/FSA</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $120,000 and $150,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p>","tags":"[]","pubDate":"2025-05-12T21:45:47.958Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/atticus/a17fec50-5b19-496d-81d1-0a3303011720","slug":"attorney-atticus-9317"},{"id":1145802780,"title":"Data Scientist ","company":"Sardine","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65879301?s=200&v=4","description":"<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Who we are:</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are a leader in fraud prevention and AML compliance.
