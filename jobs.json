The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com\">five-star reviews</a>) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In the next two years, we aim to help over 250,000 Americans get access to life changing benefits across Disability, Worker's Comp and Personal Injury cases. For this to happen , we’ll need to raise $100MM+ of asset backed capital, judiciously deploy our Series C round across the existing business and new opportunities, and evolve how the company thinks about unit economics.  As a strategic finance lead, you’ll be a key player in making that happen. In order to align profits and impact, Atticus is above average in complexity when it comes to its business model.  The finance function at Atticus is also a core part of our revenue model, so you’ll have an outsized role in shaping our company’s strategy.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ll report directly to our VP of Finance and work closely with our Leadership Team to play an integral role in forming our financial plan and guiding our investments. The work is varied, complex, and can be painstaking: any given week will see you  digging into our marketing mix, analyzing the LTVs of different fields of law, and creating product workflows to capture better payments data; all to drive positive financial outcomes for the business.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you want a tole that has the potential to kick start your path to being a CFO, founder, or better investor over time, you should apply. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Required:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">2+ years of investment banking experience (Top third of their class)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">2+ years of startup or growth equity experience</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience owning all workstreams on a completed financial transaction (e.g. M&amp;A, capital raise, etc.)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Mastery of all aspects of financial statements</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Comfort managing through ambiguity and working with limited data</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Excellent verbal and written communication skills</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">15 vacation days &amp; ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">401(k) and optional HSA/FSA</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $140,000 to $160,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p>","tags":"[\"finance\",\"legal\"]","pubDate":"2025-04-22T02:09:47.561Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/atticus/0c8624e2-25e3-4a26-8235-b6056202b5e6","slug":"strategic-finance-lead-atticus-7592"},{"id":2654699543,"title":"Lead Product Manager, Brokerage","company":"Alpaca","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30398729?s=200&v=4","description":"&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;c-message_kit__blocks c-message_kit__blocks--rich_text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;c-message__message_blocks c-message__message_blocks--rich_text&quot; data-qa=&quot;message-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;p-block_kit_renderer&quot; data-qa=&quot;block-kit-renderer&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper--first&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;p-rich_text_block&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who We Are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alpaca is a US California headquartered brokerage infrastructure technology company and self-clearing broker-dealer, delivering execution and custody solutions for Stocks, ETFs, Options, Cryptocurrencies, and more, and has raised over $170 million in funding.
