The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just five years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid (see our <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com\"><u>14,000+ five-star reviews</u></a>), and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’ve raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to 151 last year and we expect to grow again in 2025.<br /></p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus works in an industry dominated by outdated technology that is ripe for fresh thinking: our core competitors rely on massive call centers to screen clients, antiquated CRMs to track and manage cases, and paper checks to get paid (provided they’re sent to the right address). </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As a VC-backed tech company our product &amp; engineering department powers everything we do: from creating an engaging online experience for people in crisis to providing tools for our network lawyers as they serve our clients, Atticus relies on technology to fulfill our mission.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for a QA Engineer to join our team. You’ll work on testing services and web applications, and will partner with every department at Atticus as we continue to grow our platform that helps people in need find trusted legal support.  <br /></p><h2><strong>What You'll Do:</strong></h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Contribute to Atticus’ testing strategy with a focus on performance, modularity, extensibility, and reliability.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Create and validate detailed test plans in a collaborative environment with software engineers.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Work with Product to evaluate and refine product details and acceptance criteria.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Collaborate with the lead SDET to inspire developers and other stakeholders to create excellent products and services.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Execute regression and functional testing across all aspects of our product</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Identify, track, triage, prioritize and document issues through to resolution</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup that doubles as a B-corp social enterprise. Every project you take on will help clients in need get the help they deserve, and you’ll shape our company culture as we scale. We’re looking for testers who are excited about our mission and the challenges it entails.<br /></p><h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Required:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You've got 1-3 years of relevant experience as a QA engineer or similar role.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You enjoy working with UI and UX experts to test compelling user experiences.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You enjoy teaching and mentoring teammates on testing best practices.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve tested both services and web platforms extensively.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have experience using Postman for API testing and validation.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You've embedded with a team to document test cases in close collaboration with product, engineering, and design.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You've got a track record of creating or improving a QA process to measurably increase product quality.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Bonus / Nice-to-Have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience with Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, Git, GitLab, Git, Golang, TypeScript</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience with Playwright or similar testing frameworks such as Selenium/Cypress</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have experience working with a team outside of QA that relies on QA's work (CX, Ops, Engineering, Product, Design)</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.<br /></p><h2><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">15 vacation days &amp; ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Student loan repayment assistance, 401(k), and optional HSA</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free snacks, drinks, weekly lunches, and regular team dinners/events/retreats</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $90,000 to $130,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.<br /></p><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, about half our team is in Los Angeles and half are fully remote and spread across the U.S. There are two options for this job:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Reside in Los Angeles, work a few days a week (or more) out of our beautiful Chinatown office, a walk away from notable LA cafes and eateries.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Live wherever, work remotely (ideally PST hours), and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between monthly and quarterly.</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In short: You can do this job well remotely, and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. But we care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><br /><br /></p>","tags":"[\"typescript\",\"engineering\",\"legal\"]","pubDate":"2025-03-14T18:58:02.096Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/atticus/67fe92f6-249f-492e-b282-8c331160c968","slug":"qa-engineer-atticus-4569"},{"id":7168847310,"title":"Business Development Representative","company":"Canonical","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53057619?s=200&v=4","description":"&lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets.

We’re a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country. This is the dream that drove Wences Casares, our Founder and Chairman, to quietly transform the world of banking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien.

Building on a cloud native runtime optimises application life-cycle management, including scaling to meet demand, resource utilisation, orchestration across available resources, and recovery from failures with minimum downtime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will be at the driving seat of the developer experience platform team, by creating a self-serve, seamless and secure journey for Engineering and allowing them for shorter Speed to Market.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This approach reduces cognitive load on teams (they have less to think about) and it creates a standard way of building software. This brings additional benefits with onboarding new developers or adding additional development teams. The platform team also has a role to play in developer mentoring and support; helping development teams understand how good cloud native software operates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In successful software organisations, development teams can consume core services in a self-service manner from a central platform team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Examples of such services include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure provisioning (Compute, Network, Storage)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CI/CD pipelines and underlying tooling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Standardised mechanisms to log, monitor and troubleshoot their services in all environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Codified templates to create new services in line with agreed architectural patterns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We rely on the following tools and technologies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Terraform&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;AWS (ECS, RDS, SQS, VPC, KMS)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GCP (Cloud run, Cloud functions, Datastream, BigQuery)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Docker&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GitHub and GitHub Actions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Newrelic/PagerDuty&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The development community are your core customers.

Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company is founder led, profitable and growing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are hiring &lt;strong&gt;2024 and 2025 Graduate Software Engineers&lt;/strong&gt; into engineering teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware, kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are excited about the potential that open source has for humanity and the enterprise, you have outstanding results in your academic career, and you are excited to contribute to the open source stack, this is the best way to apply to Canonical. We will work with you to identify teams and projects that would be interesting and a good fit for your skills and motivations. The process is highly competitive, it will require effort and excellence to succeed if you apply here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most of our engineering teams work from home. We try to align a single team in a single time zone - EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean), and AMER (North, South and Central Americas). Even though you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams that work well in the &#39;fishbowl&#39; of open source engineering. This is full time work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant responsibility. We don&#39;t generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep &#39;sprint&#39; with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a meaningful impact to open source, and see some very interesting new cities that you might never otherwise get to visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you find the open source stack amazing, and you have been a consistent high-performing student in your school and university, then this will be a challenging and exciting start to your career.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a Globally remote role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The role entails&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shaping the roadmap for your product at global sprints every six months&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Focusing on design and user experience, even for developer tooling and command line apps&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Writing high quality, resilient and performant code, potentially serving millions of demanding daily users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working towards mastery of key programming languages and Linux system knowledge&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Engaging with users and the open source community through code reviews and issue trackers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Responding to customer issues as a priority, develop an understanding of enterprise requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Developing skills and awareness of security in software design and implementation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Business Informatics, Mathematics or another STEM discipline with programming courses&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Confidence to get started and deliver high quality code in one of Python, Rust, C/C++, Golang, JavaScript or Java&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Ubuntu or another Linux distribution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding results&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Result-oriented and organized, with the drive to meet commitments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Personal projects in technology and software engineering beyond the curriculum&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Personal responsibility and accountability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thoughtfulness, self-awareness and the ability to reflect and develop&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel internationally twice a year for company events up to two weeks long&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Nice-to-have skills&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Upstream open source contributions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Packaging and Linux distribution contributions - Debian, Fedora, Arch, Nix or another&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leadership and organization skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Presentation and writing skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Business and commercial interests&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide.

We have more junior roles for exceptional individuals with a proven personal interest an engagement in cyber attack and defence, and outstanding academic and career performance even if experience is limited.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to build an entirely new level of assurance and observable rigour into the open source supply chain.

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 70,000 people in need (see our <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com\">6,000+ five-star reviews</a>) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We just closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 52 to 91 last year and we expect to grow again in 2024.<br /></p><h3><strong>The Job</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To provide a great experience for a client, we have to do a lot quickly: Understand their situation, identify their needs, give advice, match them with the right lawyer, connect them to that lawyer, convince both parties to work together, and formalize the arrangement — all while doing our best to make a complex and scary system feel simple, accessible, and human. We’ve managed to do all of this in a way that users love, but we’ve done it by leaving some parts of the process quite manual... which means we can only scale so far.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your job is to change that: to lead the effort to transform our product into a platform that can serve millions of people.
