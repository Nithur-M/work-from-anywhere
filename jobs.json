You'll do so by intervening directly on the codebase, mentoring other engineers, and making them fall into the pit of success.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are also a contributor to our roadmap, identifying new opportunities thanks in particular to your awareness of both the latest advancements in technology and the EdTech market.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">All engineers are expected to spend a majority of their time building the product themselves, as Individual Contributors. Team leadership is a temporary (and possibly part-time) role one can move in and out of without it being considered a promotion or demotion.</p><h1>Tech stack</h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our product is built with TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and React, plus the frameworks Next.js and Nest.js. Newer parts of our product rely on postgreSQL and ElasticSearch, and Rivet to build advanced LLM workflows based on various third-party models.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We use Jest as our main tests runner, with a combination of unit, integration and end-to-end tests, both on the front-end (using Playwright) and API endpoints.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our hosting is entirely cloud-based, we are currently in the process of moving our infrastructure to Qovery.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our observability stack is built with Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, Sentry, Langfuse and Gentrace.</p></li></ul><h1>Your profile</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We're hiring primarily in \"senior plus\" positions, meaning that we want you to own large projects in collaboration with other Product Engineers, and help us define what we should do next.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You should have a strong track record showing us you're able to do just that. We're quite open-minded about the variety of previous experiences that can lead you to us. Having a diploma from school A or having worked at company Z is one signal among many others. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We do however have a few expectations in terms of previous experience, skills, and mindset:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your have a recent experience as an Individual Contributor in a product-oriented company (B2B SaaS is a plus).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are familiar with our tech stack, in particular you are not afraid of the JavaScript ecosystem, crazy as it might be! We do not require a long, professional experience with it; but you'll need to master key principles and be able to write some code during the tech interview (you can use LLMs but we'll check that you understand what you accept).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">T-shaped profile: you have a full-stack mindset (eager to dig into the back-end, front-end or infrastructure aspects of a problem) with a spike in one area in particular where you excel.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Sense of ownership: you have a holistic approach to problem solving, you are able to make decisions after collecting data and input from relevant stakeholders, even if there's no clear consensus, and you are accountable for them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Team spirit: you do your best to align yourself and the people around you with the company's mission, strategy and culture. You are operationally flexible, and able to adapt to an evolving environment.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are excited to work in a written-first and async-first environment (though we still have many occasions to speak face-to-face!), where radical transparency is a core value.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have a stellar communication, especially in written form. You welcome feedback and challenges; you can express your point of view clearly and without compromission, but also without antagonizing others, in a way that moves conversations towards a conclusion.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">People love working with you: you have a positive energy, you like to help others even when it's not your responsibility, and you place a high premium on maintaining good relationships with the team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are passionate about technology and how to use it to solve real-life problems, in particular in the field of education and training. You are aware of the GenAI field, and you know how to leverage it, including in your job as an engineer.</p></li></ul><h1>Interview process</h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Apply to this position by answering a few written questions. Though we love LLMs, please use your own words 🙏 We don't expect more than a paragraph per question.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If your profile catches our attention, we'll invite you for a screening interview. We'll ask you a few questions and you'll have time to ask us questions too.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If we're both willing to move forward, we'll send a take-home exercise and we'll schedule a technical interview with our engineers.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Finally, you'll have a chat about product engineering and our company culture with our CTO and/or a Product Manager.</p></li></ul><h1>Language and location</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Didask is transitioning to English as our internal working language in 2025. Professional proficiency in English is required. Speaking French is optional.

We value diversity in all of its forms, and we hire the best person we can for each role, no matter your personal background. Research tells us that applicants who are female or non-binary, as well as applicants who are people of color, are less likely to apply for roles they do not feel 100% qualified for. If you think you meet more than 50% of our requirements but fewer than 100% of them, please apply. We’re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn’t apply.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kit does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;","tags":"[\"management\",\"engineering\"]","pubDate":"2024-12-06T20:08:54.000Z","link":"https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/convertkit/jobs/4594101007","slug":"engineering-manager-ruby-on-rails-react-kit-9771"},{"id":3945326346,"title":"EMEA Sales Lead","company":"Sardine","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65879301?s=200&v=4","description":"<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Who we are:</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are a leader in fraud prevention and AML compliance.
