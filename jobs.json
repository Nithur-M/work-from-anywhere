If content is the fuel that keeps the marketing engine running, then you are the person in charge of creating and distributing that fuel—making sure it meets the needs of our ideal customers and drives engagement, demand, and brand affinity.</p><p>Right now, our lean two-person content team is focused on driving our core content initiatives, which include quarterly live sessions, the monthly Resourceful newsletter, our always-on SEO program, and our LinkedIn presence. That’s where you come in: your support will enable us to keep these channels going and also explore new formats.</p><p>This role will build on what’s working, experiment with new ideas, and explore untapped opportunities—whether that’s video, community, conferences, podcasts, or something new altogether. With you on board, we will also be able to collaborate more closely with product marketing, and keep delivering content that stands out and drives both brand awareness and customer growth. Some people <em>might</em> say that resource management is not the most exciting of topics... we disagree!, and we think there are a lot of opportunities for us to be creative, opinionated, and unique in this space 😉</p><p>You will take ownership of key content activities, support product marketing efforts, and be a hands-on leader and driver within the content team. If you’re a strategic thinker who loves creating high-impact content and isn’t afraid to experiment, we’d love to hear from you.</p><p>Our Content Lead, Fio, explains the important role you will play within our Marketing team. <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/215474fd0d6748e093289200d8f224e6?sid=1cdac2bf-81f4-4f7b-a8f3-22a3d918dbac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external\"><strong>Watch this video</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/215474fd0d6748e093289200d8f224e6-b96f8b3709aa4f80-full-play.gif\" width=\"640px\" height=\"auto\" style=\"width:640px;height:auto;\"></p><p>You’ll be working asynchronously with a bright, dedicated team from across the globe, with a strong focus on taking complex problems and creating solutions that feel simple and intuitive for our customers.</p><h3><strong>What you’ll be responsible for</strong></h3><p>Early on, you’ll jump right into:</p><ul> <li> <strong>Own and drive our content calendar:</strong> partner with brand, content, performance, and product marketing to ensure alignment across initiatives.</li> <li> <strong>Lead our always-on SEO program:</strong> actively work on optimization opportunities and on-page improvements, and collaborate with our external agency on research, briefing, and reporting.</li> <li> <strong>Plan and develop content across our other channels:</strong> collaborate with our Content Marketer Stella on the execution of written and visual content for LinkedIn, live sessions, monthly newsletter, customer stories, and more.</li> </ul><p>Once you are a bit more settled, we expect that you will jump into the following projects:</p><ul> <li> <strong>Support product marketing:</strong> partner with Alexandria, our Senior Product Marketer, to create product-focused content for our product newsletter, new feature releases, and integrated product launch campaigns (we've got some big ones coming up 🎉).</li> <li> <strong>Maintain and improve our content production engine:</strong> ensure our content effectively supports product and performance marketing efforts. Think of content as the fuel that keeps our marketing engine running—so we can reach our target audience.</li> <li> <strong>Measure and report on performance:</strong> while not expected to be a data expert, you should be fluent in GA4 and content-relevant reporting tools to track success and iterate based on results.</li> <li> <strong>Keep key content assets up-to-date:</strong> regularly review and update long-form guides, listicles, and other content to align with new messaging and product features.</li> <li> <strong>Take on the management of one teammate:</strong> after your first 90 days, take on the people management of our awesome Content Marketer, Stella, including regular 1:1s and content planning sessions.</li> </ul><h3><strong>What you’ll need to be successful</strong></h3><p>We want you to love your work and believe that these skills will allow you to succeed in the role. Applying these skills requires:</p><ul> <li> <strong>Experience across multiple content formats:</strong> a successful candidate will come with experience in B2B content marketing, likely in a SaaS scale-up environment. Our marketing team is five people, so you’ll be successful if you’re used to working autonomously without the support of a large marketing department.</li> <li> <strong>Hands-on SEO experience:</strong> ability to research and brief opportunities, optimize content, report on results, and collaborate with vendors.</li> <li> <strong>Versatility in content creation:</strong> experience switching between written formats (articles, newsletters, product updates) and video formats (Canva templates, video cutting and light editing, webinar hosting, short-form video creation).</li> <li> <strong>Understanding of content marketing trends:</strong> you’re curious by nature and in-the-know of what’s on the up; you use AI tools to support your content workflows, and know how to experiment and implement new ideas quickly.</li> <li> <strong>Customer-centric mindset:</strong> willingness to deeply understand how our customers use our product.</li> <li> <strong>Coaching, mentorship, or management skills:</strong> as you’ll be managing one teammate, experience in a management role or with coaching or mentorship skills will help in this role.</li> <li> <strong>Excellent communication and attention to detail:</strong> your work will be seen by thousands of people daily, requiring precision, clarity, and autonomy.</li> </ul><p>As a fully remote team, we’re looking for someone comfortable with asynchronous communication as the default, which means you have previous remote experience and are comfortable using tools like Slack, Loom, and Linear to communicate as needed.
