Answering a simple question like <em>“Who are the biggest Ethereum token holders over time?”</em> requires an engineering team to run their own RPC nodes, ingest the full history of the blockchain, clean the data, transform the data and finally summon a wizard to cast a complex SQL query.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Accessing data is hard because blockchains are optimized for Writes and not Reads</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Why is it so hard? Blockchains have historically been optimized for Writes (getting data onto the blockchain) and less for Reads (getting data OUT of the blockchain). This is because optimization efforts were focused on increasing transaction throughput and building fault tolerant and scalable consensus algorithms. This neglect makes it hard to get data out efficiently and reliably at scale.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Parsing and interpreting blockchain data requires both deep domain expertise and data manipulation</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">To quote Tim Roughgarden, Columbia Professor, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tim_Roughgarden/status/1512847113599729668\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>“Blockchains are (virtual) computers, not databases.”</u></em></a>  They are Turing machines that support general computations, and anyone can write and deploy their own smart contract for their own use case. This nearly infinite number of use cases leads to the fragmentation of data schemas for different purposes. Standardizing these schemas requires deep domain expertise to turn esoteric technical outputs into clear information for specific concepts like tokens, NFTs, stablecoins and DEXs.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Allium abstracts the complexity with a simple way to query blockchain data</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Allium tames the chaos by ingesting, sanitizing, and standardizing all this data. As of this post, the data we’ve archived across 40+ blockchains is in the petabytes and growing exponentially.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Google and Bloomberg had to organize the world's public financial and webpage data, Allium is on a mission to do the same for blockchain data</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">This is one of the rare times in history where indexing a giant public dataset is sorely needed by all - similar to what Bloomberg did for financial data and what Google organized for public webpage data.

A win yesterday does not guarantee (or even imply!) a win tomorrow. I hope anyone who supports a failing sports team will feel the pain (<em>cough Man United fan</em>s) of inconsistency</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Figure It Out &amp; Extreme Ownership</strong> - Every day is unexplored territory. There are new engineering frameworks, new legal docs, new compliance, new sales, new regulations, and new operational procedures every single day. If you don’t know it, learn it. If you can’t learn it, find someone or a product that does it. If you can’t find someone, find someone who can find someone.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>High Agency</strong> - (One of) the highest commonality between all successful people is their responsiveness, most successful billionaire CEOs still reply to emails within minutes (within working hours). And when you reply, respond fast with effective solutions - and even better, resolutions. If you’re looking for a superpower, you can’t go wrong with responsiveness. Well of course this doesn't make sense when you're an engineer coding in flow, but in general high agency of problem solving gets one very far in life</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Leading from the Front </strong>- No one is going to listen (and adopt) your suggestion unless you lead by example. It’s one thing to say <em>We need to do XYZ this better </em>&amp; it’s another thing to build an MVP and say <em>“This is the way we should do things”. </em>The proof of work and momentum goes a long way.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Strong Opinions On the Future (loosely held) </strong>It is okay to be wrong, but what is not okay is not to have an idea of how a better future should be. Alliumites take pride in trying to improving everything about the company all the time.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Sense of (allium) business smell</strong> - There are number of folks who live to eat at Allium, but the Allium smell we are talking about is that we love folks who naturally want to know why and how the work they are doing builds leverage for their teammates and also relates to the business goals</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">About the team</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We invite people of all backgrounds (<a href=\"https://www.allium.so/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.allium.so/about</a>).

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're a small but growing team — we expanded from 89 to over 151 members last year, and we anticipate further growth in 2025.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Growing the number of clients we serve at Atticus is one of the hardest and most rewarding things we do. Because the legal marketing space is highly competitive and heavily regulated, we seek innovative ways to reach our clients during the biggest crises of their lives while also setting Atticus apart from sketchy billboard lawyers and sell-your-info schemes. The Growth Lead role mixes traditional marketing and acquisition (testing new platforms, managing campaigns, gathering and analyzing data) with responsibilities unique to a quickly scaling a tech company (developing partnerships, working with product leaders to tailor our UX to different audiences, creative briefing, and building our data infrastructure). In a typical week, you might do any or all of the following:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Launch and improve upon new marketing campaigns on paid social channels</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"> Partner with Creative to drive our paid social creative process, from concept development &amp; briefing to test roadmap creation</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Leverage contractors or creative agencies as needed to augment our internal capabilities</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Work with Product and Engineering teams to tailor client product experience to the needs of our unique audience</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Help create the strategy for growing our client acquisition machine as we scale Atticus from Series B to owning the market</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup in a position that mixes growth marketing execution and innovation, encourages mentorship from leaders across a variety of disciplines, and prioritizes autonomy to shape our acquisition strategy as we scale.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Qualifications:</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Required:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You joined a top digital advertising agency or growth-marketing organization out of college and have been promoted because of your stellar performance.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have strong quantitative analytical skills and are comfortable working in data analytics platforms and data visualization software.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re an ambitious self-starter. You thrive in ambiguous environments and enjoy a strategic challenge.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re a kind and thoughtful colleague who knows how to shape a great team culture and thoughtfully analyze data and communicate insights.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have a demonstrated commitment to doing good and helping people.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Bonus / Nice-to-Have:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience using Looker, SQL, Google Analytics, and Google Tag Manager</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience using Google and Meta Ads and have a track record of improving paid media campaigns.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience using digital marketing platforms (e.g., Google and Meta Ads) and have a track record of improving paid media campaigns</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience designing and producing digital ads</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">15 vacation days &amp; ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">401(k) and optional HSA/FSA</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $130,000 to $155,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p>","tags":"[\"engineering\",\"legal\"]","pubDate":"2025-05-02T19:14:13.670Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/atticus/8b2a79af-a220-488d-9e08-f6db910b0b79","slug":"growth-lead-paid-social-atticus-549"},{"id":4335987141,"title":"Staff Product Designer, Developer Experience","company":"Livekit","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69438833?s=200&v=4","description":"<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">While LiveKit operates as an infrastructure company, we believe that every detail matters—from backend to frontend, from a single line of code to a single pixel.

We help creators grow and monetize their audience with ease. For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn’t a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products - all within one platform. More importantly, there isn’t a team more committed to helping creators earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform.

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com\">five-star reviews</a>) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In the next two years, we aim to help over 250,000 Americans get access to life changing benefits across Disability, Worker's Comp and Personal Injury cases. For this to happen , we’ll need to raise $100MM+ of asset backed capital, judiciously deploy our Series C round across the existing business and new opportunities, and evolve how the company thinks about unit economics.

We help creators grow and monetize their audience with ease. For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn’t a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products - all within one platform. More importantly, there isn’t a team more committed to helping creators earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform.

You&#39;ll join a collaborative team of engineers responsible for providing in-app business analytics to our creators, building a scalable full-stack framework to power actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a hands-on role for someone who loves Ruby, thrives in legacy codebases, and thinks like a systems architect. You&#39;ll collaborate across product, engineering, and design to ship large, complex projects—everything from architecting scalable backend solutions to refining the frontend presentation of metrics and visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We need someone with a can-do attitude who can navigate complex technical challenges and push through obstacles.

Every day, scientists use BioRender to tell the story of a new vaccine, cancer therapy, or fundamental biological discovery. Your work will help make those breakthroughs understandable to collaborators, investors, clinicians, students, and even the public — and ultimately get discoveries to market faster.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We're looking for a visionary Head of ML to help us build something extraordinary: tools that transform how scientific knowledge is created, shared, and understood. This isn't just about making pretty pictures – it's about democratizing scientific knowledge and accelerating discovery on a global scale.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><br /></p><h2><strong>The Challenge</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scientists are struggling to communicate their work in a world drowning in information. The tools they use to visualize and explain their research haven't fundamentally changed in decades. We're changing that.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our tools are already used by over a million scientists worldwide. With over 24 million scientific figures created, no one else has our depth of experience in scientific communication. Over 3 million researchers at the world’s top universities, pharmaceutical companies, and scientific journals rely on us every day to help them communicate their work.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">But we're just getting started. With ML, we can create tools that fundamentally change how scientific knowledge is created and shared – making it more accessible, understandable, and impactful for everyone.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>What you’ll build:</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As BioRender’s Head of ML, you’ll lead the transformation of figure creation from a manual, expert-driven process into one that’s intelligent, intuitive, and automated — without compromising scientific accuracy or visual quality. You’ll architect systems that deeply understand biological language, experimental context, and visual storytelling. You will:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Invent and scale ML-powered figure generation that converts natural language descriptions (e.g. “Create a figure of a tissue sample preparation protocol”) into accurate, editable, and publication-ready scientific figures.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Design multimodal learning systems that understand the relationships between biological text, icons, diagrams, and templates — and generate figures grounded in scientific semantics, not just visual patterns.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Build generative visual models that learn from BioRender’s proprietary dataset: tens of millions of labeled scientific icons, diagrams, templates, and user-generated figures — the world's richest corpus of visual scientific knowledge.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Develop user-facing creative ML tools that scientists trust and love — from intelligent figure auto-complete and layout optimization, to context-aware suggestions and scientific diagram summarization.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ship high-impact ML infrastructure that powers new experiences across BioRender's ecosystem — from slide generation and visual storyboarding to contextual education and scientific communication in new formats.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">All of this will be built within the constraints of scientific accuracy, user editability, and domain trust — a challenge as hard as it is meaningful.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Who you are:</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You're an ML leader with a rare combination of technical depth and user obsession. You’re excited to take on some of the hardest UX and ML challenges in visual creativity — in a domain (biology) where getting it right matters. You might be a strong fit if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve built and led frontier ML teams in areas like generative modeling, computer vision, or multimodal learning — and shipped products with millions of users.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You deeply understand generative models (transformers, diffusion, image/text embedding models, etc.) and have applied them to real-world creative workflows — especially where visual accuracy and human-in-the-loop tooling matter.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You think beyond models. You know success is measured in delight, trust, and adoption by real users. You think holistically about model training, UX scaffolding, latency tradeoffs, prompt design, evaluation frameworks, and safety/guardrails.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re curious about biology and motivated by the idea of helping scientists share their discoveries faster, clearer, and further. Experience in life sciences is a bonus, but not required.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You lead with clarity and ambition. You set technical vision, rally world-class ML talent, and prioritize ruthlessly to drive toward step-change innovation, not incremental improvements.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Why BioRender?</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A data and domain moat you can’t find anywhere else</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">BioRender is the only company in the world with this kind of data:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">30M+ professionally curated scientific icons and components</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Top quartile for profitability and revenue growth, users in 200+ countries</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Millions of annotated user-generated figures and templates, spanning every field of biology</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Deep semantic metadata about biological systems, experimental techniques, and visual storytelling conventions</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A product scientists already love. We’re not starting from zero. BioRender is used by over 1.5 million scientists at 800+ institutions and every top pharma company. NPS scores rival the best creative tools in the world. With the trust and adoption of the scientific community, we’re uniquely positioned to introduce ML into scientific workflows in a way that feels magical — not disruptive.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Work your way: Remote-first with team members across North America (and a Toronto office if you want it)</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We care about what you can do, not how you learned to do it. If you're excited about using ML to transform scientific communication, we want to talk – regardless of your background or path.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">BioRender is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus operates in a space where speed, security, and the seamless integration of tools directly improve our ability to help people in crisis. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for a System Administrator to join our team and take ownership of our IT systems — from GCP and Google Workspace to device management, cybersecurity, and beyond.

The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly.
