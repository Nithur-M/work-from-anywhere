We help creators grow and monetize their audience with ease. For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn’t a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products - all within one platform. More importantly, there isn’t a team more committed to helping creators earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform. We have always been 100% independent and 100% remote. We are proud to have built a product that our customers love, and we look for people who have enthusiasm and belief in our mission, vision, and values to join our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Kit culture is one where emotional intelligence is valued, radical candor is encouraged, and where everyone works together to uphold a set of shared team principles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;strong&gt;Creator Representative&lt;/strong&gt; on the Kit Ads team, you will be responsible for overseeing the Ads lifecycle—from onboarding new creators and consulting on ad monetization strategies, to optimizing performance and reporting. Serving as the go-to advisor and advocate for creators, you’ll recommend best practices, help creators maximize revenue from their newsletters and content, and ensure a seamless experience for brands. You’ll act as a liaison between creators and internal teams—namely Product, Engineering, and Sales—and play a key role in refining Kit’s ad program to drive sustainable growth for both creators and Kit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll report into the Head of Kit Ads and collaborate closely with the Kit Ads Sales team, Finance, Marketing, and external ad tech providers.
