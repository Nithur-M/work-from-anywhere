As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well.

Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Ownership</strong>: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture.

different sections of the company.</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Looking for:</strong> How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Offer and Details Chat with CEO</strong></p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Finally,

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 20,000 people in need (see our 12,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 91 to over 150 last year and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><h3><strong>The Job</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our business generates a wealth of data with untapped potential to support people in need of aid, and improve their likelihood of positive outcomes in the legal system. Our platform covers a lot: evaluating a client’s case, giving advice, matching them with the right lawyer, formalizing the arrangement, and helping both parties work together as the case progresses. The data we generate across this end-to-end journey provides a unique opportunity to improve client experiences at a national scale for the legal practice areas we support, using novel data unavailable to other industry actors (individual law firms, government agencies).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are looking for Data Scientists to join our team and leverage this data to fulfill our mission.

The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><h3><strong>Location</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, about a third of our team are in Los Angeles (where we are headquartered) and the rest are fully remote and spread across the U.S. There are two options for this job:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Live in Los Angeles, work a few days a week (or more) out of our beautiful office downtown.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues — typically once or twice per quarter.</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In short: You can do this job well remotely, and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. But we care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><br /><br /></p>","tags":"[\"legal\"]","pubDate":"2025-01-28T22:30:25.188Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/atticus/9b841d71-e185-4d4d-ad38-7ffcbc886dd5","slug":"data-scientist-atticus-7210"},{"id":3024640966,"title":"iOS Security Engineer","company":"Fingerprint","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67208791?s=200&v=4","description":"&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fingerprint&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;empowers developers to stop online fraud at the source.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We work on turning radical new ideas in the fraud detection space into reality.

You are a facilitator and multiplier on any team’s success you’re deployed to by helping design impactful experiments to learn and push performance to new heights.

We seek exceptional individuals around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn, create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don&#39;t track hours, but we do manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones, are highly async, and like to document a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around the world for our company offsites.
