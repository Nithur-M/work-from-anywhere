The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 20,000 people in need (see our <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com\">6,000+ five-star reviews</a>) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We just closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 52 to 91 last year and we expect to grow again in 2024.</p><h3><strong>The Job</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Social Security disability benefits are a key feature of this country’s safety net. But when folks try to access these benefits, they find themselves pitted against the Social Security Administration — an outdated bureaucracy deadset on denying them benefits. The Direct Representation team evens the odds: we take on the SSA for our clients – and we win. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">People who success in this role are excited about: </p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Driving client relationships;</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Collaborating with attorneys on case strategy;</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Shaping evidence to win client cases;</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Working with other teams at Atticus to improve how we serve all clients; and</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Redefining what high quality representation looks like in disability proceedings.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup and gain exposure to both legal practice and business operations — and mentorship from folks who've been in your shoes. It’s designed to be a path to (a) staying at Atticus and advancing on the Direct Representation team, or (b) heading to law school or business school (we'll help you with applications and we write great recs). </p><h3><strong>Qualifications</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Required:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have 1+ years of experience succeeding in a professional role that required a substantial amount of client-facing work (like a case manager) or lawyer-facing work (like a paralegal). </p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You earned a degree from a top college or university where you demonstrated strong academic performance.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are comfortable in a variety of interpersonal conversations; you can be empathetic and kind when speaking with average people in a moment of crisis, and can be thoughtful and organized when interacting with attorneys.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are a resourceful team-player ready to dive into a scrappy startup environment where you will learn quickly and get your hands dirty.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have a demonstrated commitment to doing good and helping people.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Bonus / Nice-to-Have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have professional experience helping others apply for government benefits.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have experience at a startup or other fast-paced, agile environment. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech or law, we’d love to meet you.</p><h3><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">15 vacation days &amp; 16 paid holidays each year</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$1,000/year reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work </p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">401(k) and optional HSA</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free snacks, drinks, weekly lunches, and regular team dinners/events/retreats</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $60,000 and $85,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><h3><strong>Location</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p>","tags":"[\"legal\"]","pubDate":"2025-01-06T22:48:39.766Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/atticus/bbfe10c4-9228-494f-9f4c-83679fb6e3ff","slug":"paralegal-client-manager-atticus-8990"},{"id":5823979889,"title":"Software Engineer - Source [IC2]","company":"Sourcegraph","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3979584?s=200&v=4","description":"&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a112ff;&quot;&gt;Who we are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI.

Join us to help shape the future of education!</p><h1>Job description</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As a Software Engineer at Didask, you'll be part of the product team that build our next-generation Learning Management System (LMS) and our brand new Learning Assistant.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Working as <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" class=\"wui-link\" href=\"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/\">Product Engineers</a>, you'll have a large scope of ownership to solve our end-user's pain points:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Shape the best solution by engaging with Product Managers and Designers</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Bring these solutions to life (system design, architecture, coding, etc.) in collaboration with other Engineers</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ship it and make sure it ends up solving the problem you've been tasked to solve</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As a senior member of the team, you'll have a key role in making sure our product is secure, reliable and performant. You'll do so by intervening directly on the codebase, mentoring other engineers, and making them fall into the pit of success.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are also a contributor to our roadmap, identifying new opportunities thanks in particular to your awareness of both the latest advancements in technology and the EdTech market.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">All engineers are expected to spend a majority of their time building the product themselves, as Individual Contributors. Team leadership is a temporary (and possibly part-time) role one can move in and out of without it being considered a promotion or demotion.</p><h1>Tech stack</h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our product is built with TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and React, plus the frameworks Next.js and Nest.js. Newer parts of our product rely on postgreSQL and ElasticSearch, and Rivet to build advanced LLM workflows based on various third-party models.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We use Jest as our main tests runner, with a combination of unit, integration and end-to-end tests, both on the front-end (using Playwright) and API endpoints.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our hosting is entirely cloud-based, we are currently in the process of moving our infrastructure to Qovery.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our observability stack is built with Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, Sentry, Langfuse and Gentrace.</p></li></ul><h1>Your profile</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We're hiring primarily in \"senior plus\" positions, meaning that we want you to own large projects in collaboration with other Product Engineers, and help us define what we should do next.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You should have a strong track record showing us you're able to do just that. We're quite open-minded about the variety of previous experiences that can lead you to us. Having a diploma from school A or having worked at company Z is one signal among many others. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We do however have a few expectations in terms of previous experience, skills, and mindset:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your have a recent experience as an Individual Contributor in a product-oriented company (B2B SaaS is a plus).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are familiar with our tech stack, in particular you are not afraid of the JavaScript ecosystem, crazy as it might be! We do not require a long, professional experience with it; but you'll need to master key principles and be able to write some code during the tech interview (you can use LLMs but we'll check that you understand what you accept).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">T-shaped profile: you have a full-stack mindset (eager to dig into the back-end, front-end or infrastructure aspects of a problem) with a spike in one area in particular where you excel.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Sense of ownership: you have a holistic approach to problem solving, you are able to make decisions after collecting data and input from relevant stakeholders, even if there's no clear consensus, and you are accountable for them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Team spirit: you do your best to align yourself and the people around you with the company's mission, strategy and culture. You are operationally flexible, and able to adapt to an evolving environment.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are excited to work in a written-first and async-first environment (though we still have many occasions to speak face-to-face!), where radical transparency is a core value.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have a stellar communication, especially in written form. You welcome feedback and challenges; you can express your point of view clearly and without compromission, but also without antagonizing others, in a way that moves conversations towards a conclusion.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">People love working with you: you have a positive energy, you like to help others even when it's not your responsibility, and you place a high premium on maintaining good relationships with the team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are passionate about technology and how to use it to solve real-life problems, in particular in the field of education and training. You are aware of the GenAI field, and you know how to leverage it, including in your job as an engineer.</p></li></ul><h1>Interview process</h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Apply to this position by answering a few written questions. Though we love LLMs, please use your own words 🙏 We don't expect more than a paragraph per question.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If your profile catches our attention, we'll invite you for a screening interview. We'll ask you a few questions and you'll have time to ask us questions too.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If we're both willing to move forward, we'll send a take-home exercise and we'll schedule a technical interview with our engineers.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Finally, you'll have a chat about product engineering and our company culture with our CTO and/or a Product Manager.</p></li></ul><h1>Language and location</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Didask is transitioning to English as our internal working language in 2025. Professional proficiency in English is required. Speaking French is optional. The team will make sure you never feel excluded if you don't.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unless specified otherwise, all our positions are remote-first. At the moment, we can only accept candidates who are French fiscal residents. You can work from anywhere in a timezone close to ours, as long as you have good working conditions (including a good Internet connection for fluid videoconferencing).</p>","tags":"[\"postgres\",\"javascript\",\"typescript\",\"management\",\"engineering\",\"b2b\",\"mongo\"]","pubDate":"2024-12-10T14:13:50.186Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/didask/c15df717-f37a-4855-b8d7-b69699a2be17","slug":"software-engineer-senior-staff-principal-didask-2646"}]
