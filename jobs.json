Every day, scientists use BioRender to tell the story of a new vaccine, cancer therapy, or fundamental biological discovery. Your work will help make those breakthroughs understandable to collaborators, investors, clinicians, students, and even the public ‚Äî and ultimately get discoveries to market faster.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We're looking for a visionary Head of ML to help us build something extraordinary: tools that transform how scientific knowledge is created, shared, and understood. This isn't just about making pretty pictures ‚Äì it's about democratizing scientific knowledge and accelerating discovery on a global scale.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><br /></p><h2><strong>The Challenge</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scientists are struggling to communicate their work in a world drowning in information. The tools they use to visualize and explain their research haven't fundamentally changed in decades. We're changing that.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our tools are already used by over a million scientists worldwide. With over 24 million scientific figures created, no one else has our depth of experience in scientific communication. Over 3 million researchers at the world‚Äôs top universities, pharmaceutical companies, and scientific journals rely on us every day to help them communicate their work.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">But we're just getting started.

You‚Äôll architect systems that deeply understand biological language, experimental context, and visual storytelling. You will:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Invent and scale ML-powered figure generation that converts natural language descriptions (e.g. ‚ÄúCreate a figure of a tissue sample preparation protocol‚Äù) into accurate, editable, and publication-ready scientific figures.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Design multimodal learning systems that understand the relationships between biological text, icons, diagrams, and templates ‚Äî and generate figures grounded in scientific semantics, not just visual patterns.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Build generative visual models that learn from BioRender‚Äôs proprietary dataset: tens of millions of labeled scientific icons, diagrams, templates, and user-generated figures ‚Äî the world's richest corpus of visual scientific knowledge.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Develop user-facing creative ML tools that scientists trust and love ‚Äî from intelligent figure auto-complete and layout optimization, to context-aware suggestions and scientific diagram summarization.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ship high-impact ML infrastructure that powers new experiences across BioRender's ecosystem ‚Äî from slide generation and visual storyboarding to contextual education and scientific communication in new formats.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">All of this will be built within the constraints of scientific accuracy, user editability, and domain trust ‚Äî a challenge as hard as it is meaningful.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Who you are:</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You're an ML leader with a rare combination of technical depth and user obsession.

You might be a strong fit if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You‚Äôve built and led frontier ML teams in areas like generative modeling, computer vision, or multimodal learning ‚Äî and shipped products with millions of users.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You deeply understand generative models (transformers, diffusion, image/text embedding models, etc.) and have applied them to real-world creative workflows ‚Äî especially where visual accuracy and human-in-the-loop tooling matter.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You think beyond models. You know success is measured in delight, trust, and adoption by real users. You think holistically about model training, UX scaffolding, latency tradeoffs, prompt design, evaluation frameworks, and safety/guardrails.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You‚Äôre curious about biology and motivated by the idea of helping scientists share their discoveries faster, clearer, and further. Experience in life sciences is a bonus, but not required.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You lead with clarity and ambition.

We‚Äôre not starting from zero. BioRender is used by over 1.5 million scientists at 800+ institutions and every top pharma company. NPS scores rival the best creative tools in the world. With the trust and adoption of the scientific community, we‚Äôre uniquely positioned to introduce ML into scientific workflows in a way that feels magical ‚Äî not disruptive.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Work your way: Remote-first with team members across North America (and a Toronto office if you want it)</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We care about what you can do, not how you learned to do it.
