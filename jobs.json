We are on a journey to transform the experience that people all over the world have with their open source software by significantly expanding the range of software we can deliver through this system.

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it.¬†</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we‚Äôve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we‚Äôve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we‚Äôre just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast ‚Äî our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To provide a great experience for a client, we have to do a lot quickly. Understand their situation, identify their needs, give advice, match them with the right lawyer, connect them to that lawyer, convince both parties to work together, and formalize the arrangement ‚Äî all while doing our best to make a complex and scary system feel simple, accessible, and human.

In the last 6 years we‚Äôve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits.

So far, we‚Äôve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we‚Äôre just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.)

In the last 6 years we‚Äôve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits.

For this to happen , we‚Äôll need to raise $100MM+ of asset backed capital, judiciously deploy our Series C round across the existing business and new opportunities, and evolve how the company thinks about unit economics.  As a strategic finance lead, you‚Äôll be a key player in making that happen. In order to align profits and impact, Atticus is above average in complexity when it comes to its business model.

Every day, scientists use BioRender to tell the story of a new vaccine, cancer therapy, or fundamental biological discovery. Your work will help make those breakthroughs understandable to collaborators, investors, clinicians, students, and even the public ‚Äî and ultimately get discoveries to market faster.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We're looking for a visionary Head of ML to help us build something extraordinary: tools that transform how scientific knowledge is created, shared, and understood. This isn't just about making pretty pictures ‚Äì it's about democratizing scientific knowledge and accelerating discovery on a global scale.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><br /></p><h2><strong>The Challenge</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scientists are struggling to communicate their work in a world drowning in information. The tools they use to visualize and explain their research haven't fundamentally changed in decades. We're changing that.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our tools are already used by over a million scientists worldwide. With over 24 million scientific figures created, no one else has our depth of experience in scientific communication. Over 3 million researchers at the world‚Äôs top universities, pharmaceutical companies, and scientific journals rely on us every day to help them communicate their work.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">But we're just getting started. With ML, we can create tools that fundamentally change how scientific knowledge is created and shared ‚Äì making it more accessible, understandable, and impactful for everyone.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>What you‚Äôll build:</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As BioRender‚Äôs Head of ML, you‚Äôll lead the transformation of figure creation from a manual, expert-driven process into one that‚Äôs intelligent, intuitive, and automated ‚Äî without compromising scientific accuracy or visual quality. You‚Äôll architect systems that deeply understand biological language, experimental context, and visual storytelling. You will:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Invent and scale ML-powered figure generation that converts natural language descriptions (e.g. ‚ÄúCreate a figure of a tissue sample preparation protocol‚Äù) into accurate, editable, and publication-ready scientific figures.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Design multimodal learning systems that understand the relationships between biological text, icons, diagrams, and templates ‚Äî and generate figures grounded in scientific semantics, not just visual patterns.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Build generative visual models that learn from BioRender‚Äôs proprietary dataset: tens of millions of labeled scientific icons, diagrams, templates, and user-generated figures ‚Äî the world's richest corpus of visual scientific knowledge.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Develop user-facing creative ML tools that scientists trust and love ‚Äî from intelligent figure auto-complete and layout optimization, to context-aware suggestions and scientific diagram summarization.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ship high-impact ML infrastructure that powers new experiences across BioRender's ecosystem ‚Äî from slide generation and visual storyboarding to contextual education and scientific communication in new formats.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">All of this will be built within the constraints of scientific accuracy, user editability, and domain trust ‚Äî a challenge as hard as it is meaningful.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Who you are:</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You're an ML leader with a rare combination of technical depth and user obsession.

You might be a strong fit if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You‚Äôve built and led frontier ML teams in areas like generative modeling, computer vision, or multimodal learning ‚Äî and shipped products with millions of users.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You deeply understand generative models (transformers, diffusion, image/text embedding models, etc.) and have applied them to real-world creative workflows ‚Äî especially where visual accuracy and human-in-the-loop tooling matter.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You think beyond models. You know success is measured in delight, trust, and adoption by real users. You think holistically about model training, UX scaffolding, latency tradeoffs, prompt design, evaluation frameworks, and safety/guardrails.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You‚Äôre curious about biology and motivated by the idea of helping scientists share their discoveries faster, clearer, and further. Experience in life sciences is a bonus, but not required.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You lead with clarity and ambition.

Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are hiring Embedded / IoT Sales Representatives to expand our reach in mission-critical industries such as Automotive, Medical Devices, Industrial Systems, Robotics, and Telco, as well as consumer electronics. We are looking for candidates who are technically skilled and familiar with embedded Linux and RTOS. We are expanding in all time zones, so we can accommodate candidates from almost any country as long as they have reasonable business access to a substantial market territory in person. As we grow our teams, we will also hire Sales Team Managers and Regional Sales Directors. Please continue with this process if your goal is a management leadership position.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The server edition of Ubuntu is already very widely used in connected devices and industrial PCs. Our newer edition of Ubuntu for IoT, called Ubuntu Core, represents the state of the art in security and resilience for high-end appliances and equipment. Our customers include global brands in consumer and industrial electronics, as well as automotive and robotics. We continue to expand our range of offerings to bring our security, management, and developer experience to the smallest Linux environments and devices. We recently added a real-time Linux capability and are working towards a range of certifications for these offerings. Together, this portfolio is Linux reinvented for optimal reliability, security, developer productivity, and footprint.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a prospecting sales and strategic account development role and requires energy, ambition, and focus. To be successful, you must be comfortable positioning and selling open source, services, and software solutions to all levels of an organization, and specifically to departments that are developing embedded software and IoT devices. You should also be familiar with at least one of our priority sectors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Customers love the idea that they can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across every cloud, every class of compute, and every category of application. Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support, managed services, consulting, and training services to customers who are deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote, and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position; it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision-making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long-term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world-leading company, we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment that promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration, and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In building our sales team, we look for five things:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Teamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Energy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu is already very widely adopted, which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with brands in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement, and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgment as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete, and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate will carry an annual bookings quota within their assigned territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagement, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness, to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account strategy. They must be comfortable selling enterprise software, open source, cloud, virtualization, container technologies, and technical software solutions to senior levels of the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location: &lt;/strong&gt;We are growing our sales reach in all regions - EMEA, APAC, and Americas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role entails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building and executinge a territory plan to prioritize leading security-focused brands and manufacturers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working with marketing to promote our brand and increase market awareness in prioritized accounts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Developing pipeline through outreach, prospecting, local marketing, and industry events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Closinge contracts to meet and exceed quarterly and annual bookings targets and achieve strategic objectives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Managinge customer relationships and interactions through all stages of the sales cycle&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working with IoT Field Engineers to understand customer requirements and ensure customer satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintaining accurate data and forecasts within Salesforce&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establishing productive professional relationships with key influencers and decision-makers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coordinatinge with colleagues, including support, delivery, and management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undergraduate degree in a technical subject&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Confidence to respectfully speak up, exchange feedback, and share ideas without hesitation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding results&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Field sales experience in embedded Linux, embedded software, or enterprise software&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of achievement of sales targets and large account wins&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passion for technology evidenced by personal projects and initiatives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The work ethic and confidence to shine alongside motivated colleagues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Appreciative of diversity, polite, and effective in a multi-cultural, multi-national organization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thoughtfulness and self-motivation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel internationally twice a year, for company events up to two weeks long&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Willingness to travel up to 50% for customer meetings and industry events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to develop and execute territory sales plans&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Detail oriented with effective follow-up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide.

Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You‚Äôll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology.

Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable, and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of ‚Äòmost software to most companies‚Äô. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding developers themselves. They should be completely at home reviewing a patch or a software design spec. They are trusted engineers who understand the importance of a whole-team effort in creating great products and who enjoy seeing colleagues develop. They should contribute code themselves to set the standard for coding, but know that the code they write is far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team‚Äôs direction, focus, and delivery. We grow management skills and train engineers who are interested in soft skills to be managers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A typical first-level software engineering team is based in a single time zone, such as EMEA or Americas, or APAC, with an Engineering Manager and a Senior Engineer dedicated to a single product, who work as a team to shape the roadmap, technical strategy, code, documentation, and community engagement. They are both capable of coding, and are both leaders comfortable assigning work and maintaining expectations of delivery. They will both be expected to take management training at Canonical so they speak the same language when it comes to team behaviours, habits, routines, norms, and standards, but they focus on different sides of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An Engineering Manager is responsible for line management and career guidance. The ability to develop engineering talent, to represent your team and product from a technical perspective, and to drive collaboration with other teams and customers are all critical to success in this role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have open manager roles across a wide range of engineering domains, including:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Python and Golang&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;C / C++ / Rust&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Data infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;HTML / CSS / JavaScript / Typescript / React&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flutter&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Distro packaging and systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SAAS and web microservices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kernel&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Servers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Graphics, Browser and Desktop&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Silicon enablement and embedded devices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Product Security&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If your domain of expertise isn‚Äôt listed above, yet you feel it‚Äôs relevant to Canonical, then feel free to apply anyway.
