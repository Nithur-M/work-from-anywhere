The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it.¬†</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we‚Äôve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we‚Äôve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we‚Äôre just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast ‚Äî our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In the next two years, we aim to help over 250,000 Americans get access to life changing benefits across Disability, Worker's Comp and Personal Injury cases. To make that happen, we‚Äôll need to achieve ambitious hiring plans while building a values-driven and high-performing organization where great work gets done.¬†</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As a People Lead, you‚Äôll report to our Head of People and play a key role in guiding, building and executing our HR and talent strategy. The work will be varied, highly cross-functional, and have impact across every team in our organization: any given week could see you benchmarking our total rewards strategy, designing new mechanisms to collect organization-wide feedback, analyzing our People technology stack for efficiency and cost opportunities, and serving as program manager, content strategist and part-time facilitator for our annual retreat. This role is designed to give exposure to every part of HR, talent and people operations, include mentorship from leaders who have scaled organizations, and is a path to growing as a People executive.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Required:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have demonstrated success in (1) the People function at a growth-stage start-up <em>or </em>(2) were/are at a top consulting firm focused on People topics, and have been promoted at least once¬†</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You‚Äôve led HR and talent projects where you mapped complex systems, gathered and analyzed data and feedback, made recommendations, and implemented effective, measurable solutions.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You‚Äôre a kind and thoughtful colleague who knows how to shape a great team culture, persuasively advocate for your ideas, and get buy-in from others.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have a demonstrated commitment to doing good and helping people.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you‚Äôre from a background that‚Äôs underrepresented in tech, we‚Äôd love to meet you.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We‚Äôre a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We offer competitive pay ‚Äî including equity ‚Äî and generous benefits:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">15 vacation days &amp; ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">401(k) and optional HSA/FSA</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues¬†</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $120,000 and $160,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate‚Äôs experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This job is fully remote and we‚Äôre committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues ‚Äîsomewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p>","tags":"[\"legal\"]","pubDate":"2025-05-17T01:11:03.309Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/atticus/e6d42168-e30e-4d92-8e3b-eaf0913ead71","slug":"people-lead-atticus-6343"},{"id":6357643246,"title":"Support Engineer [IC1]","company":"Sourcegraph","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3979584?s=200&v=4","description":"&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who we are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world‚Äôs most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI.
