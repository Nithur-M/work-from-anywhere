You’ll serve as our first in-house legal hire, partnering closely with the executive team to lead commercial legal strategy and execution—especially around contracts, compliance, and M&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll help shape the legal backbone of a fast-moving tech company with four revenue streams—including SaaS, digital commerce, and advertising—and a rapidly growing platform for creators.

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In the next two years, we aim to help over 250,000 Americans get access to life changing benefits across Disability, Worker's Comp and Personal Injury cases. To make that happen, we’ll need to achieve ambitious hiring plans while building a values-driven and high-performing organization where great work gets done. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As a People Lead, you’ll report to our Head of People and play a key role in guiding, building and executing our HR and talent strategy. The work will be varied, highly cross-functional, and have impact across every team in our organization: any given week could see you benchmarking our total rewards strategy, designing new mechanisms to collect organization-wide feedback, analyzing our People technology stack for efficiency and cost opportunities, and serving as program manager, content strategist and part-time facilitator for our annual retreat. This role is designed to give exposure to every part of HR, talent and people operations, include mentorship from leaders who have scaled organizations, and is a path to growing as a People executive.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Required:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have demonstrated success in (1) the People function at a growth-stage start-up <em>or </em>(2) were/are at a top consulting firm focused on People topics, and have been promoted at least once </p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve led HR and talent projects where you mapped complex systems, gathered and analyzed data and feedback, made recommendations, and implemented effective, measurable solutions.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re a kind and thoughtful colleague who knows how to shape a great team culture, persuasively advocate for your ideas, and get buy-in from others.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have a demonstrated commitment to doing good and helping people.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">15 vacation days &amp; ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">401(k) and optional HSA/FSA</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $120,000 and $160,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p>","tags":"[\"legal\"]","pubDate":"2025-05-17T01:11:03.309Z","link":"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/atticus/e6d42168-e30e-4d92-8e3b-eaf0913ead71","slug":"people-lead-atticus-9155"},{"id":3170275316,"title":"Support Engineer [IC1]","company":"Sourcegraph","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3979584?s=200&v=4","description":"&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who we are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI.

We help creators grow and monetize their audience with ease. For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn&#39;t a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products — all within one platform. More importantly, there isn&#39;t a team more committed to helping creators earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform. We have always been 100% independent and 100% remote. We are proud to have built a product that our customers love, and we look for people who have enthusiasm and belief in our mission, vision, and values to join our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re also embracing AI thoughtfully — both in how we build and how we hire to ensure our team is adaptable, innovative, and ready for what&#39;s next.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Kit culture is one where emotional intelligence is valued, radical candor is encouraged, and where everyone works together to uphold a set of shared team principles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re hiring a Senior Financial Analyst to own our financial forecasting and bring sharp, strategic insight to every corner of the business. This is a high-autonomy, high-impact individual contributor role that supports our Head of Finance in partnering with the exec team on forward-looking analysis that drives real decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re a SaaS platform, so metrics like MRR, LTV, CAC, and activation are core to how we operate. If those are second nature to you, keep reading. You’ll connect the dots between those levers and their revenue impact—turning pricing, retention, and growth signals into forecasts the business can actually use. You’ll also work closely with our Data team to uplevel how we use metrics to guide the business.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your support system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll report to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonywakim/&quot;&gt;Anthony Wakim&lt;/a&gt;, our Head of Finance. He’ll help you ramp, set context, and be a sounding board—but this role is all about ownership. You’ll lead forecasting, reporting, and decision support from the start.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We keep our in-house finance team lean (just two people), but you’ll have strong external partners on accounting and ops. You’ll also have access to our full finance stack (Runway, Stripe, Quicksite, QuickBooks), and tight collaboration with Product, Sales, Marketing, and Data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First week:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Get oriented on Kit’s business model, customer segments, and SaaS metrics. Meet your manager and key partners across Product, Marketing, Sales, and Data. Audit our existing reports, forecasts, and dashboards. Shadow our monthly forecasting cycle. Complete a quick breakeven analysis to support pricing and margin decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First month:&lt;/strong&gt; Start contributing to forecast updates. Collaborate with cross-functional teams to refine assumptions, track trends, and sharpen insights. Support exec-level financial narratives and scenario modeling to guide key business decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First six months: &lt;/strong&gt;Partner with Data to level up finance dashboards. Build models that map growth levers—like activation, retention, pricing, and CAC efficiency—directly to revenue and profitability. Run pricing simulations, model activation improvements on MRR and retention, and assess plan-level margin across customer segments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First year:&lt;/strong&gt; Help evolve Kit’s operating model to support scale. Maintain financial frameworks that connect metrics to revenue, headcount, and unit economics. Partner with the Head of Finance to strengthen forecast accuracy and decision-making tools. Support GTM strategy through CAC payback modeling, discounting analysis, and performance insights across channels and segments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will set you up for success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ve built your own forecasting models—and know how to pressure test them&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You think in systems, not just spreadsheets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You communicate clearly and turn complex data into compelling stories&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You thrive in fast-moving, high-autonomy environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ve worked with modern finance stacks (e.g. Stripe, BI tools, Runway, Netsuite)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bonus: You’re comfortable writing SQL to pull and explore your own data&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;7+ years in FP&amp;amp;A, strategic finance, or an adjacent analytical role&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deep knowledge of SaaS metrics and how growth levers affect the P&amp;amp;L, ideally gained in a growth-stage or recurring revenue company&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comfortable collaborating across Product, Marketing, Sales, and Data&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ve presented to execs and built tools (like pricing calculators or retention models) that influenced business decisions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bonus: You’ve implemented or scaled FP&amp;amp;A platforms like Runway, Mosaic, or Pigment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’re analytical, curious, and want to understand how everything connects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’re dependable, proactive, and take full ownership from analysis to outcome&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’re a strong partner—collaborative, communicative, and follow through&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You like structure, but you don’t need it—you’re energized by ambiguity and open-ended challenges&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits section&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kit has standardized salaries based on position, no matter where you live.
