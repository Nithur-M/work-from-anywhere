                <p>As our <strong>3D Quality Assurance Specialist</strong> for Grip you provide input to all the photo-realistic content that is created in our in-house 3D studio within e-commerce/digital marketing. With your product photography knowledge, you know what makes an image appealing and you make sure we can deliver the best quality to our clients, aligning on their creative strategy and brand identity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You understand what a technically and visually good image is. It’s a real mix of QA (technical requirements) as well as creative (beautiful content).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What’s Grip?</strong></p>
<p>Grip supports brands to cope with the fast-accelerating challenge of the exponential grow and need for content. Grip is web-based software that automatically generates visual content. It’s based on photorealistic 3D, capitalising on INDG’s twenty-year-long experience in that field. 3D is good because once your beer or your juicer or your rocket is on Grip, it can be used and re-used for multiple media: images, videos, iOS apps, and such. Check out the website <a href="https://www.grip.tools/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This vision has worked quite well with clients: in less than two years, Grip won Coca-Cola, Nivea, Heineken, L'Oreal and others. As you can imagine, working with these companies requires knowing why, when and how they produce the thousands of visuals we've been trying to automate. Now, Grip is changing every day to accommodate the things we learn.</p>
