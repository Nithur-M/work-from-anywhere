<div>üëã Thanks for stopping by and learning more about this role at Sitemate! ‚ú®üèóÔ∏è</div><div><br></div><div>We‚Äôd love to hear from you üôÇ üë©‚Äçüíªüë©üèΩ‚Äçüíªüßëüèø‚Äçüíªüë®üèª‚Äçüíª</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Brief overview of this role at Sitemate:</strong></div><ul>
<li>We are looking for a senior level mobile / full stack software engineer to join our engineering team and lead our two React Native mobile projects.</li>
<li>This role would be great for you if you are looking for more technical authority and autonomy around your work on mobile projects. Maybe you are working in a bigger team and don‚Äôt have any opportunities to take a lead role. Maybe you‚Äôve worked in startups or had your own startup that has finished up, and you want to join a startup team that move quickly and place a huge emphasis on product and engineering.</li>
<li>You will have opportunities such as becoming a foundational member of our engineering team, regardless of your location. You will have the opportunity to pull responsibility and technical ownership off of our CTO‚Äôs ‚Äòplate‚Äô, and make it your own area of expertise. You will have the opportunity to learn (and improve) complex mobile-specific challenges such as sharing components between mobile applications, full offline mode, real-time syncing between mobile and web and native multimedia uploading. You will have direct engagement, collaboration and communication with our Head of Product, Head of Design &amp; UX and product-focused CEO.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Employment Type:</strong></div><ul>
<li>Full-time.</li>
<li>Preferred Based: Melbourne, Sydney, Remote Australia, America, Canada, Vancouver, Brazil, Asia (Philipines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia) *</li>

</li>
<li>We have equal opportunity for applicants of all genders, ethnicity and sexualities - Sitemate's team is proudly diverse.</li>
<li>You will have flexible working options - our team is a blend of fully remote and hubs around offices. People based in hub cities typically work in the office 2-3 days per week, and 2-3 days working from home.</li>
<li>You will be remunerated based on your performance. If you are performing well, you won‚Äôt need to wait 3 years or have to find better offers elsewhere to receive an increase to your remuneration. 7 out of the last 10 remuneration increases for Sitemate team members have been made pro-actively by management, without the individual needing to even raise the topic of remuneration.</li>
<li>You will get a laptop and a budget to set up your home office (standing desk, monitor, headphones etc).</li>
<li>You will be able to attend company-sponsored training, workshops or conferences that help with your role.</li>
<li>You will get additional benefits and support as parents - with paid leave for both primary and secondary carers (includes adoption), as well as support and leave for the tragic circumstances of stillbirth.</li>
<li>You will get equity options and ownership in Sitemate on a standard vesting schedule. See here a general overview of how this works: <a href="https://legalvision.com.au/5-essential-elements-employee-share-scheme/">https://legalvision.com.au/5-essential-elements-employee-share-scheme/</a>
</li>
<li>Sitemate has grown from 5 people in 2018 to now over 40, and we‚Äôre now moving into the next stage of growing to 100 people! We have a product that customers are strongly engaged with, and every month we get around 300-400 new leads whilst spending $0 on marketing and 0 cold calling.</li>
<li>Sitemate‚Äôs founders have diverse backgrounds - one with coming from engineering on major infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges and tunnels, the second coming from product and graphic design. This brings a unique perspective internally where we blend deep industry experience with a passion (obsession) for modern best practices in product design.</li>
<li>Sitemate graduated from Australia‚Äôs #1 Technology Company Accelerator - Startmate (complete coincidence on the names‚Ä¶ üòÖ).</li>
<li>Sitemate has strong financial backing from Blackbird (Australia and NZ‚Äôs #1 Vc) and Shearwater Growth Capital (founded by two Directors of WiseTech - a $14B software company for the logistics industry).</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What is the working environment like at Sitemate?</strong></div><ul>
<li>We are very transparent - monthly allhands meetings provide the team with direct insight into team updates, customer stories, hiring plans and key metrics (NPS, Revenue, Financial Performance). During this allhands meeting we also hear one ‚Äòlife story‚Äô from one of our team each month - learning about different countries and cultures around the world.</li>
<li>We place an extremely high value on your time - you won‚Äôt be spending your days wasting time on fighting internal systems, botched together spreadsheet processes or doing data entry.</li>
<li>We use best in class systems that are seamlessly integrated to deliver our team the right information at the right time, allowing them to get their work done efficiently and to a very high standard.</li>
<li>You will have a core and close team around you, but you will also be exposed to and working directly with multiple departments - engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and customer success.</li>
<li>You will have a high degree of autonomy, as the focus is on outcomes and not hours. If you want to block off a few hours to run a personal errand - no worries. If you want to block off an hour to pick up the kids from school - no worries. No one will be monitoring your time.</li>
<li>We are constantly working to minimise the number of group meetings - daily check ins are all done asynchronously (in your own time) each morning. But spontaneous 1:1s or small sessions are strongly encouraged!</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What does Sitemate do, exactly?</strong></div><ul>
<li>Sitemate builds best in class software products for the built world.</li>
<li>Industrial companies operating in the built world are facing a number of mission critical challenges - changes in work behaviour due to covid-19, Generation Z starting to enter the workforce as mobile first users of software, and the drastic shift away from traditional mining to renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar farms.</li>
<li>See here an example wind farm project that is powered by Sitemate: <a href="https://roadbridge.ie/projects/beinn-an-tuirc-windfarm-phase-3/">https://roadbridge.ie/projects/beinn-an-tuirc-windfarm-phase-3/</a>

</li>
<li>Our first product - Dashpivot, is a platform where industrial style companies streamline and standardise their processes in a new digital format. This new digital format enables them to complete and track work in the field on a mobile or tablet, and automate repetitive tasks and tracking through automated workflows and real-time analytics.</li>

</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What will I be doing day to day in this role?</strong></div><ul>
<li>Take technical ownership of our two mobile products &amp; their backends - developing new features, fixing bugs, re-architecting core components functions.</li>
<li>Inheriting the technical vision for our mobile products from our CTO, improving it, and ensuring all work day to day is working towards this technical vision.</li>
<li>Working closely with our delivery team (product owner &amp; QA Engineers), product team and broader engineering team. As a senior engineer, you will be expected to coordinate the mobile projects and will be the point of contact for our CTO and CEO.</li>
<li>Assisting our delivery team with diagnosing any production issues by investigating bugsnag and datadog logs, and then creating hotfix releases accordingly.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What will be the biggest challenges for me in this role?</strong></div><ul>
<li>As you will be working directly with our CTO (a former founder) and our Founder/CEO, you will need to be able to manage communication, problem solving and your own technical execution/contributions.</li>
<li>You will need to be acutely aware of your own productivity and ensure that you are always driving towards outcomes that will impact users.</li>
<li>Our mobile products seem simple to our users, but contain a high degree of technical complexity - from shared components across multiple mobile apps, to backend services that only serve the mobile client - there will be a lot to learn.</li>
<li>We will be completely re-architecting our product‚Äôs hierarchy in the next 12 months from a rigid tree/folder structure to a flexible tree/folder structure, which will nearly certainly require refactoring every part of our product üôÉ.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What kind of skills and experience do I need to have? (Ideally most but not all)</strong></div><ul>
<li>Javascript/Typescript experience is preferred.</li>
<li>React Native experience is preferred.</li>
<li>Node, Serverless &amp; AWS experience a bonus.</li>
<li>MongoDB &amp; DynamoDB experience is a bonus.</li>
<li>Native mobile experience is a bonus (as per above, we are planning on forking a portion of our React Native app to enable the usage of native components for multimedia uploading).</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>FAQs</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>What does the application and interview process look like? And how long does it take?</strong></div><div>Once you have expressed interest, we have an online application form that is connected to our internal systems. Following on from this, we have a combination of an online self service quiz and interviews. Usually it will only take a day or two to hear an update on next steps, and the overall process for those who make it all the way through, will usually take a couple of weeks.</div><div><br></div><div>*Note for remote candidates - Sitemate has a standardised COL (Cost of Living) multiplier that is applied to the remuneration bands shown, based on your location, it may go up or down.</div>

  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> 
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://visible.vc">https://visible.vc</a>
</p>

<h3><strong>Welcome!</strong></h3><p><a href="https://visible.vc/">Visible</a> is on a mission to help startup founders succeed. We‚Äôre achieving this by building best-in-class tools for startups and the venture capital investors who back them.</p><p>Visible is a profitable, established software startup made up of 13 fully remote teammates across the globe and has been set up this way since Visible was founded in 2015 (we have this whole remote work thing down).</p><h3><strong>Role Overview:</strong></h3><p>We are looking for a full-stack, mid-to-senior-level engineer to join our small engineering team and help scale our product to support¬†our next stage of growth. Here is what to expect:</p><p>Our stack includes a Ruby on Rails API, PostgreSQL, Redis and Ember.js. We deploy to Heroku and Vercel and use Docker for local development. We have many different challenges that range from implementing product features to DevOps-type work and performance optimization. Other notable tools &amp; frameworks you will be working with include Tailwind CSS, AWS, Mobiledoc, and a lot of 3rd party APIs.</p><p>We favor full-stack engineers who¬†have a good understanding of the entire scope of an application, but you don‚Äôt need to know both Rails and Ember to apply (however, for this position experience with one of the js frameworks is preferred and Ember experience is a big bonus).</p><p>You will work closely with our engineering team, product designer,¬†and¬†CEO, helping guide product direction and execution. Some things you might find yourself working on in the first couple of months:</p><ul>
<li><p>Participate in a <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">cycle</a> where you are actively pitching, shaping, and building product features.</p></li>
<li><p>Build new and improve existing <a href="https://visible.vc/integrations/">integrations</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Help rebuild our marketing website.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Pair with other engineers on the team and our product designer, participate in engineering calls (we do weekly mob programming sessions).</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Working at Visible</strong></h3><p>We empower our people. As long as it is aligned with the company vision, everyone has a lot of liberty in choosing what to work on. We have a combined approach, both data-driven and user-driven. We work hard to create a culture where people ask questions and challenge what is being worked on.</p><p>Given that we are distributed, we end up working across multiple time zones and put an emphasis on being able to work asynchronously.</p><ul>
<li><p>We document everything we do in Notion, Slack, and GitHub.</p></li>
<li><p>We use Slack for daily lightweight stand-ups.</p></li>
<li><p>We meet virtually as a team 3x per week. This typically includes an all-hands, product standup, and a fun wild card day (we often play codenames or <a href="http://jackbox.tv/">jackbox.tv</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Offsites throughout the year for fun and strategic planning.</p></li>
</ul><p>We have adopted a modified version of the "<a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a>" process that fits our business and workflow. It allows us to build a high-quality product, take time to cool down, and not have to worry about looking at roadmaps that will change in the next six weeks anyway.</p><p>We have a full-time product designer, but everyone on the team is capable of producing shippable UIs and we really value a good sense of aesthetics.</p><p>We care more about quality than quantity. We spend time reducing our code and product debt. We pair whenever it is needed, we test our code, and we code review every line that goes in production. It is a great way to ensure quality and learn from each other.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Qualifications &amp; What We‚Äôre Looking For:</strong></h3><p>The following are all guide rails. Don't feel like you need to neatly check each box. If you love the role, we'd love to hear from you.</p><ul>
<li><p>You have at least 2 years of production experience with Rails/Ruby and/or Ember</p></li>
<li><p>You are comfortable working with multiple levels of the stack (JS, backend, database)</p></li>
<li><p>You want to be part of a small, growth-minded team</p></li>
<li><p>You care about writing clear, well-tested, maintainable code</p></li>
</ul><p><strong>Bonus points if you</strong></p><ul>
<li><p>Worked on Ember projects before (and enjoyed it)</p></li>
<li><p>Have experience working with 3rd-party APIs, designing RESTfull APIs</p></li>
<li><p>Have experience or interest in DevOps</p></li>
<li>
<p>Have previous experience building a startup product for scale</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Why Choose Visible:</strong></h3><p>üí•Visible Impact: We‚Äôre a small yet highly efficient team. This means your work will have a direct and visible impact on the growth of our company.</p><p>üíµ Ownership: Both in the work you do and equity in the company.</p><p>‚úàÔ∏è Flexibility: Fully remote work (able to work within at least 3 hours of US eastern time zone).</p><p>üíª Tech: We provide the tools you need to get your job done.</p><p>‚öïÔ∏èBenefits: 100% Health, Dental, and Vision coverage + 401(k)</p><p>üå¥ Team Offsites: Two paid team offsites per year (the last few offsites were in Mexico, Barcelona, and Amsterdam).</p><p>üìñ Vacation Time:¬† We all need a break sometimes. Visible employees get unlimited PTO.</p><p>üè¢ Space: If you‚Äôd like to work in a coworking space or upgrade your home office, we‚Äôre happy to help.</p><p>‚≠êÔ∏è Culture: A team that makes you feel cared for.</p><p><strong>Compensation:</strong></p><ul><li>
<p>Annual Salary: $90,000 - $120,000 (USD), depending on experience and location</p>
<p></p>
</li></ul><h3>The Interview Process</h3><p>We'll review your application. So long as you are thoughtful in your application, we aim to get back to you within one week.</p><ul>
<li><p>Part I: Phone Screen with a team member. We'd love to hear about your development experience but more importantly answer any questions that you have.</p></li>
<li><p>Part II: A more technical deep dive with one of our senior engineers.</p></li>
<li><p>Part III: A coding project that will be related to your work. It will take less than a day to compete and we will pay you for your work.</p></li>
<li><p>Part IV: A final call to chat about the project and get to know the rest of the team.</p></li>
