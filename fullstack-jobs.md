<h2><strong>‚ú® One platform, a whole world of opportunity¬†</strong></h2>
<p>Right now, the best jobs are limited to people in a handful of the world‚Äôs wealthiest cities, yet brilliant people are <em>everywhere</em>. Driven to overturn the status quo and distribute opportunities equally around the world, Oyster launched its global employment platform to help companies hire, pay, and care for talent anywhere.¬†</p>
<p>When it comes to global employment, we walk the walk. We‚Äôre proof that companies don't need an office to create a highly-engaged culture. Since the company‚Äôs inception in January 2020, Oyster has:</p>
üåè Created a fully-distributed, vibrant team of 500+ employees across 60+ countries
üåà Established a diverse leadership team and an employee base that‚Äôs 60% female
üèÜ Achieved one of the highest employee engagement scores in its class
ü¶Ñ <strong>Raised $150 million in Series C funding at a valuation of over $1 billion!</strong>
<p>Our momentum speaks to the power of global employment‚Äîand we‚Äôre just getting started! If you want to change the world with Oyster <em>and</em> be empowered to work remotely while doing so, we‚Äôd love for you to apply!¬†</p><h2>The Role üë©‚Äçüíª</h2>
<p><strong>Location</strong>: Anywhere within timezones UTC-8 to UTC+3. All of Oyster‚Äôs positions are fully remote and you can work from home, forever.</p>
<h2><strong>What you'll do</strong></h2>
<p>As a Fullstack Developer at Oyster, you‚Äôll get to work on both the frontend and backend of our system to deliver a holistic experience for the user. Your changes between our Rails backend and React frontend will be communicated via our GraphQL API. Being in a fullstack role enables you to see the impact your changes make on the user from end to end.</p>
<h3>Delivering projects to empower companies and remote workers</h3>
<p>You will <strong>own the delivery of user stories</strong>. You'll be writing code, tests, and debugging issues. You'll apply high standards of code quality and development best practices, such as TDD or continuous integration, and secure code thinking.</p>
<p>You'll play an important role in our delivery process. It will be important to understand the product goals and then provide technical input to specification. You'll participate in discussions on domain model design and coordinate with the Product Owner on acceptance criteria. And you'll collaborate with Lead Developers on architecture and implementation planning.</p>
<h3>Be a key part of our development team</h3>
<p>We're a young team, you'll help shape our team's process and help us make technical decisions to make us effective and a great place to work as a developer.</p>
<p>We also expect you to support developers by answering questions and offering support when needed, or to pair on complex problems.</p>
<p>And to advance technical excellence at Oyster by researching new tools and practices, taking initiative on technical improvements and refactorings, and moving best practice forward through pairing, discussions in the team.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<h2><strong>What we're looking for üìú</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">At least 1 year experience with Rub and 3+ years of experience overall.¬†</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Experience working with a frontend web framework such as React, Vue, etc.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Experience with API implementation and design.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>You'll also need</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fluent English language skills</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A drive to learn, and help the development team to progress.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>More on our teams</strong></h2>
<p>You'll be a member of one of our product teams, working on:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring automation. Hiring a team member cross-border should be quick and frictionless, but there are too many barriers to that today. Our teams on hiring automation create processes that integrate structured knowledge on hiring from dozens of countries into a seamless experience.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">HR tools for distributed teams. Companies are more and more building global, distributed teams, and they'll need the tools to enable them to work effectively.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Payroll and payments. We run complex payroll jobs that combine accounting information from over eighty countries, as well as collecting payments and disbursing millions of dollars of salary to employees every month.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise platform features. Our customers demand high quality security, access, communication, and auditing features.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Growth teams. We are growing quickly and have teams devoted to experimenting in growth hacking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Engineering at Oyster</h2>
<p>At Oyster, we are on a mission to create a more equal world by making it possible for companies everywhere to hire people anywhere. The Engineering team is responsible for building up the platform, tooling, automation, and experience to help Oyster achieve this mission. Together with Product and Design, we partner closely with subject matter experts in Finance, Legal, Workplace, and more to build and refine our offerings to make a single product that is a pleasure to work with. We‚Äôre breaking new ground in the hiring market and have a wealth of interesting challenges to tackle!</p>
<p>We seek out and build up engineers and leaders who have strong software engineering fundamentals, value transparency, promote knowledge sharing, and thrive in a distributed, remote-first, and asynchronous working environment.</p>
<p>Finally, we live and champion our company values.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We elevate talent:</strong>¬†We hire our team (using our own product!) and continue to grow their abilities through mentorship, challenges that stretch and strengthen their skills, and giving them room to explore.</li>
<li><strong>We build trust:</strong>¬†We are transparent and promote an active flow of information throughout the team. We believe that people can do their best work when they feel supported, heard, and safe to challenge ideas to make the product, and team or company stronger. To do that we value egoless sharing of information, transparency throughout the company, actively promote knowledge sharing, and promote a safe environment to try and fail. Failures are not the end; they are moments to learn and grow!</li>
<li><strong>We thrive together:</strong>¬†By building upon our first two values, we promote teamwork and collaboration to come together a globally-minded, remote-first company that values collective wins over individual wins.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our current technology stack includes Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, React, GraphQL, and we deploy to Heroku.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll receive a new M1 or M1 Pro laptop to work on, and have a stipend to equip your home office with whatever else you need to be productive at home.</p><h2><strong>ü¶™ How we work together at Oyster</strong></h2>
