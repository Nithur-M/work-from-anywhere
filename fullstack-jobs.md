<li>Write high quality code in both a high level backend language (Kotlin) and a modern front end framework (React)</li>
<li>Work with a team of highly skilled engineers to build our next generation of client facing and internal applications</li>
<li>Be responsible for the design and implementation of one or more technical areas</li>
</ul><div><strong><br>You might be a fit if you:</strong></div><ul>
<li>Have 5+ years of industry experience</li>
