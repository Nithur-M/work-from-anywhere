In a world of constraining internet connections and paid services, we think differently: we are building a free, âlow-techâ friendly platform for everyone to jump in, directly from their browser. Our platform is social by design and packed with fun games curated by our community. We want to create new virtual social spaces that fundamentally diverge from today's typical social networks, focusing a lot less on appearance and a lot more on experience. We are building a social gaming platform for all gamers who enjoy playing together.</p><p dir="ltr"><br /></p><p dir="ltr">Our startup has been growing very quickly since the end of 2020, attracting more than 40 gaming talents from developers and social media experts to designers. In June 2021, we introduced our cloud gaming beta platform featuring 80+ licensed games, including titles from industry-renowned publishers such as Codemasters, Interplay, Team 17, and Data East. Discovered and supported by Y Combinator (Twitch, Reddit, Stripe, etc), our board of advisors include former SEGA CEO Kenji Matsubara, Zynga co-founders Justin Waldron and Tom Bollich, Crunchyrollâs Kun Gao, and Humble Bundleâs Jeffrey Rosen. Our last round was led by LEGO Ventures and top gaming VC firms.</p><p dir="ltr"><br /></p><p dir="ltr">With almost half a million users who have joined us so far, our teams are prepping for our next chapter and are on the lookout for talented and motivated folks who share our passionÂ  for gaming and want to make a real impact while embracing a true startup spirit (autonomy, transparency, user centric).</p><p dir="ltr"><br /></p><p dir="ltr">Jam.gg is an equal opportunity employer and we proudly value and promote diversity in our team.
