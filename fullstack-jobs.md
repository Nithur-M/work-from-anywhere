                <h3><b>About Magna</b></h3><p>Magnaâs goal is to be the one-stop solution for all token-based crypto companies who want to track outstanding and promised token allocations, automate the distribution of those tokens, and manage information about their stakeholders. Some liken us to âCarta for Web3â.<br>Our mission is to make it easier for crypto companies to manage their tokens and tokenholders so that they can focus on their product and not custom internal tools and smart contracts as they scale. We work with projects of all sizes throughout various L1 & L2 ecosystems.<br>Tokens are amongst the core assets crypto companies use to compensate and incentivize investors, employees, advisors, and even community members. The most common use cases for Magna include:<br><ul>
<li align="left">
<b>Token Vesting</b>Â to employees and investors - Automated token distribution based on custom unlock schedules.</li>
<li align="left">
<b>Token Streaming</b>Â - Continuous distribution of tokens to stakeholders.</li>
<li align="left">
<b>Airdrops</b>Â - Vested airdrops to community members.</li>
<li align="left">
<b>Programmable Unlocks</b>Â â Distributing tokens using our SDK based on contract interactions or in-app/in-game accomplishments.</li>
<li align="left">
<b>Stakeholder Management</b>Â â Tracking tax liability and legal filings for tokenholders and more.</li>
</ul>Magnaâs platform is used by investors, employees, accountants, lawyers, and other key stakeholders throughout the crypto ecosystem.<br></p><h3><b>Why work at Magna?</b></h3><br><ul>
<li align="left"><b>Weâre a highly technical team</b></li>
<li align="left">We love the openness and transparency of web3, but weâre working in the space because of the deep technical challenges that reward builders.</li>
<li align="left">The blockchain isnât just a distributed ledger anymore, itâs a distributed state machine. At Magna, weâre not just building a new paradigm of software â weâre also trying to leverage the best of web2 while weâre at it. Itâs amazing fun if youâre a developer whoâs new to web3 and able to appreciate a lot of beautiful technical-first design decisions for the first time. (Have you ever tried to match a CUSIP number before?? Itâs painful.)</li>
