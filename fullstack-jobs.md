                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FULL STACK ENGINEER (Contract)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Dominican Republic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counterpart is an insurtech platform reimagining management and professional liability for the modern workplace. We believe that when businesses lead with clarity and confidence, they become more resilient, more innovative, and better prepared for what’s ahead. That’s why we built the first Agentic Insurance™ system — where advanced AI and deep insurance expertise come together to proactively assess, mitigate, and manage risk. Backed by A rated carriers and trusted by brokers nationwide, our platform helps small businesses grow with confidence. Join us in shaping a smarter future, helping businesses Do More With Less Risk®.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Full Stack Software Engineer, you will be a prolific individual contributor to the product, dynamic data services, and tooling that we are leveraging to shape the future of insurance. You will help bridge the gap between Product, Insurance, and Data while developing new systems and features in a ready to disrupt industry. In addition, you will help to set the culture, rituals, and processes that underpin a high functioning engineering team and the organization more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU WILL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some key projects we are working on. You will be a part of one or more of these objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modernize insurance application workflows. We are enhancing our Django system to update and automate workflows for our Risk Engineering team. You will be responsible for migrating key parts of the UI and enhancing the backend to support the best user experience possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase efficiency with AI. Collaborate with the Data and Risk Engineering teams to leverage AI across our products via a React frontend. Process documents into actionable, structured information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable small businesses to manage HR with modern software. Enhance our HR application to support its next phase of growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emerging Products. Create new services to enable our Claims team to process a larger volume of complex claims across many different insurance lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardize development processes. Work with engineering leaders to create documentation, examples, and training for the wider team. Our goal is to standardize how we do work in our Python and Javascript code bases. This will have a huge impact on our quality as we grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU HAVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A passion for programming and a love of building and experimentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5+ years of experience with Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2+ years of experience with Django&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2+ years of experience with relational databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2+ years of experience with Typescript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective communication &amp;amp; documentation skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on a remote team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please let us know if you have experience developing custom solutions in Salesforce, such as designing, integrating, and optimizing the platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you will work with&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derrick Franco, Engineering Manager:&lt;/strong&gt; After teaching himself to code at 13, Derrick went on to co-found Jumpstart in addition to building out the technical divisions at InvestorsAlley and Phinaz Media Group. Nowadays Derrick spends his time reading, with his wife, and working on his podcast The Future of Work Project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julian Prokay, Engineering Manager: &lt;/strong&gt;A veteran of the SaaS space with experience working on both student systems and construction management software. In his free time, he enjoys history podcasts and fantasy literature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ron Alexessen, Engineering Manager: &lt;/strong&gt;Ron has experience at large companies like Hewlett-Packard, New Relic, and Rackspace and feels most impactful at small firms and startups. Embracing a chaordic style, both at work and home, is just right. For balance, Ron climbs, runs, and plays a supporting role for his active teenagers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Drake, Engineering Manager: &lt;/strong&gt;David combines a theatre degree, a programming degree, and 17 years of professional software experience to bring heart and technical expertise to his engineering teams. A former founder with a Commodore 64 tattoo, he balances his passion for technology with time spent with his partner and 9-year-old daughter, as well as hobbies like reading, meditation, cooking, and exploring the outdoors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newton Troung, Engineering Manager&lt;/strong&gt;: Newton joins Counterpart with 7+ years of experience in platform and data engineering. In his last company Thrive Market, he had a hand in building out new microservices and architecting data pipelines with Airflow and Spark. He&#39;s vegetarian and loves trying new restaurants when traveling. Nowadays he&#39;s busy keeping up with his 2-year-old and doing outdoor activities with his family.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COUNTERPART&#39;S VALUES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conjoin Expectations&lt;/strong&gt; - it is the cornerstone of autonomy. Ensure you are aware of what is expected of you and clearly articulate what you expect of others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speak Boldly &amp;amp; Honestly&lt;/strong&gt; - the only failure is not learning from mistakes. Don’t cheat yourself and your colleagues of the feedback needed when&amp;nbsp; expectations aren’t being met.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Entrepreneurial&lt;/strong&gt; - control your own destiny.&amp;nbsp; Embrace action over perfection while navigating any obstacles that stand in the way of your ultimate goal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Omotenashi&lt;/strong&gt; (“selfless hospitality”) - trust will follow.&amp;nbsp; Consider every interaction with internal and external partners an opportunity to develop trust by going above and beyond what is expected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hold Nothing As Sacred&lt;/strong&gt; - create routines but modify them routinely.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;Take the time to reflect on where the business is today, where it needs to&amp;nbsp; go, and what you have to change in order to get there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Wellness&lt;/strong&gt; - some things should never be sacrificed. We create an environment that stretches everyone to grow and improve, which is fulfilling, but is only one part of a meaningful life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WE OFFER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work from Anywhere&lt;/strong&gt; - Counterpart is a fully distributed company, meaning there is no office. We allow employees to work from wherever they do their best work, of course prioritizing meetings that often happen in US time zones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language Classes - &lt;/strong&gt;We sponsor up to $100 per calendar year to be used towards language classes to help support your English language skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paid Vacation and Time Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental Leave - &lt;/strong&gt;Development Partners will be eligible for unpaid Parental Leave to bond with a newborn, newly-adopted, or newly placed child. Under this policy, development partners and independent contractors will be eligible for up to 8 weeks of unpaid parental leave. Any time off will be subject to approval and must be requested at least 45 days in advance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer - &lt;/strong&gt;We reimburse you for your locally procured Macbook Pro. If you are still with the company after one year, it is yours to keep!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our estimated pay range for this role is &lt;strong&gt;USD $75,000 - $90,000 annually&lt;/strong&gt;. Contractor compensation is determined by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, market data, location, internal equitability, and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to being a welcoming and inclusive workplace for everyone, and we are intentional about making sure people feel respected, supported and connected at work—regardless of who you are or where you come from. We value and celebrate our differences and we believe being open about who we are allows us to do the best work of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are an Equal Opportunity Employer. We do not discriminate against qualified applicants or employees on the basis of race, color, religion, gender identity, sex, sexual preference, sexual identity, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, military status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law, rule, or regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
