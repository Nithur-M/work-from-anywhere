<div>We are a small team of 3 people who decided to start our own project - build a Shopify app.</div><div>We chose a relatively small niche to compete in, so we could test whether we had what it takes to succeed. About a year later we dominated that niche! We are now serving more than 3000 merchants!<br><br>
</div><div>During that time, all of us have gone through impressive personal growth. We learned a lot. We got confidence.<br><br>
</div><div>Now we are ready to get into one of the biggest niches in the market. And eventually we will dominate it too. It will take a few years, but we know we can do it! We can do it only with <strong>your</strong> help.</div><div>
<br><strong>What will you do?</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Maintain our existing app and help build a new one. </li>
<li>Create entire big modules from scratch. </li>
<li>Tackle lots of interesting challenges. </li>
<li>Help us reach 100k merchants!</li>
<li>As one of our first employees, you will be a very important/valuable part of our team, have lots of room to develop yourself and have a big say in the direction the company takes.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who are you?</strong> </div><ul>
<li>A damn good full stack developer (senior level).</li>
<li>You are comfortable working both on front and back end, and can even contribute to UI/UX discussions.</li>
<li>Detail oriented, eager to learn and go deep, a team player.</li>
<li>You naturally like building and solving complex problems.</li>
<li>You’ve worked on multiple interesting, complex projects and you are proud of the way you built them.</li>
<li>Ideally you have a good knowledge of Ruby on Rails + Vue.js.</li>
<li>If you haven’t worked with RoR or Vue.js, but are very good at similar frameworks, e.g. Django + React, and willing to switch to our stack, we are open to consider.</li>
<li>Knowledge of ElasticSearch, AWS and deployment tools could be a big plus.</li>
<li>Good English is a must.</li>
<li>You are fine having 4 hours overlap at least with Vietnam(GMT +7) 9am-6pm </li>
