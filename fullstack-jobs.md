</div><div><br></div><h1>About our Development team</h1><div><br></div><div>
<strong>We are a small team but growing rapidly.</strong> We have grown from a team of 9 members to 19 members in the last year and we are looking to expand further in the coming months.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>We use Agile methodologies</strong>, following the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvfz4HGtoPc">Spotify structure</a>. Our team is divided into cross functional squads who are fully responsible for a part of our product. Inside the squad we have short meetings to define our goals, share updates and blockers during the week. After each month we have a retrospective to continue to improve our processes.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>We take ownership and hold ourselves to high standards.</strong> Developers are involved in the <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/full-cycle-developers-at-netflix-a08c31f83249">whole software development life cycle</a>. You will write code but also E2E tests, migration scripts or monitor production.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>We follow best practices. </strong>Chapter leads coach squad members inspired by books like: <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658">Extreme Programming</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002">The DevOps Handbook</a>.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Our techstack is based on Javascript</strong>. We are using React in the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB in the backend, everything is hosted in AWS.<strong><br><br></strong><br>
</div><h1>What you will be working on as a Software Developer<strong><br></strong><br>
</h1><div>Depending on your interests and skills, you may do more feature work or more purely technical work, but the boundaries are fluid, and people can switch between teams. Every two weeks, you’ll have a private conversation with your manager where you can discuss these topics and more.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Build new product features. </strong>In the last 1 year our team has added many exciting features including <a href="https://help.filestage.io/en/articles/5755452-getting-started-with-the-new-project-dashboard">revamping our project dashboard</a>, allowing users to <a href="https://help.filestage.io/en/articles/5560093-compare-versions-of-a-file-directly-in-the-viewer">compare two versions of a file simultaneously</a> and allowing users to <a href="https://filestage.io/websites/">review live websites</a> on our platform. In the coming year, we are looking forward to building many more exciting features like allowing users to automate their manual processes.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Integrate with 3rd party services. </strong>In the last 1 year we have started<a href="https://filestage.io/integrations/"> integrating our platform with multiple 3rd party services</a> like Asana, Microsoft Teams, etc and built a foundation to create many more integrations. This year we are looking to integrate with Slack, Adobe Premiere Pro and others.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Track down bugs and fix them fast.</strong> There are a lot of moving parts in a SAAS app: frontend, backend, networking and integration with 3rd party services. Tracking down bugs in such an app is not only very exciting but is core to providing an exceptional user experience.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Improve our development process.</strong> We continuously improve our development process by adding new E2E tests to prevent bugs and reduce manual testing, refactoring concepts to reduce complexity, improving our CI/CD pipeline or coming up with new ideas to improve developer workflow.<br><br>
