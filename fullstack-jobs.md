There are many ways to do that, but the easiest way to help us out is by answering the following questions:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What's the URL of your website?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location: Remote - Anywhere&lt;/strong&gt; (Open to applicants located anywhere aligned with the Americas time zones.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a SiteWatch Web Engineer at 10up, you are taking the driver&#39;s seat in helping support a number of clients across multiple verticals. You will provide consultation to clients and internal teams on complicated full-stack issues while being a “jack of all trades” who can speak to all parts of a project and provide strategic value from the minutia to the big picture. You will be an authority on either JS or PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a leading digital agency, 10up&#39;s client roster spans from innovative startups and impactful non-profits to some of the biggest names in the industry, such as ESPN, Google, The New York Times Co., Microsoft, and The Nobel Prize Committee. 10uppers have been pushing the boundaries of web experiences for over 12 years—become an engineer that innovates the internet by building exciting projects alongside a top-in-the-field team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a 10upper, you have options for flexible and alternative work schedules. Intentionally remote since day one, spanning six continents and 40 countries, 10up fully embraces the benefits of distributed work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you will do:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with Clients: Participate actively in client meetings, respond to tickets, clarify requirements, and maintain strong live communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop Enterprise-Level WordPress Solutions: Build and maintain complex WordPress plugins, themes, and custom Gutenberg blocks using PHP and React.js.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support &amp;amp; shape our product offerings: Help support and enhance our public product offerings like ElasticPress.io and SiteWatch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handle Legacy Code and Databases: Debug and improve legacy systems, ensuring seamless functionality and integration with existing architectures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage Diverse, High-Volume Projects: Work on multiple concurrent client projects, often switching contexts daily while maintaining quality and efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead Technical Strategy: Define technical visions for complex builds, create accurate estimates, and guide technical direction in collaboration with cross-disciplinary teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advance Engineering Standards: Contribute to reusable tools, process improvements, and best practices while exploring new technologies to enhance client success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About you:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective Communicator: You excel at explaining technical concepts in client-friendly terms and thrive in real-time, live client interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WordPress Pro: Experienced with PHP, Gutenberg block development, and React.js. You can confidently build solutions by leveraging documentation and learning new techniques independently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem-Solver: Skilled at debugging, optimizing legacy codebases, and navigating complex database structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adaptable and Organized: Comfortable managing a high workload, switching between 5–10 clients in a day, and delivering high-quality work under varying demands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-Starter and Learner: Eager to tackle emerging technologies like Elasticsearch and AI while applying knowledge to solve practical client challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote Work Advocate: Thrives in distributed teams, engaging effectively while working from a location of your choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of interest:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple paid time off programs, including PTO, parental leave, bereavement leave, and company holidays – including an all-company break from Christmas Eve to New Years Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health, dental, and life insurance programs (available for United States and UK team members)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retirement contribution programs (currently available in the U.S. and U.K.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible and alternate schedule programs - including options for 4-day work week (Monday-Thursday) configurations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1,000 accrued annually in professional development budget for you to spend on conferences, training, or to buy back time for programs like independent study&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global Company summits – opportunities to meet, socialize, and learn with fellow team members in person at remarkable destinations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An end-of-year all-hands bonus program, along with smaller opportunities for recognition throughout the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expected annual salary range for this position is between &lt;strong&gt;$90,000 and $110,000 USD&lt;/strong&gt;. Compensation is determined based on a variety of factors including relevant experience, other job related qualifications/skills, geographic location, and business needs.&lt;/p&gt;

                <h1><strong>About Atticus</strong></h1><p style="min-height:1.5em">At any given time, 16 million Americans are experiencing a crisis that requires urgent help from our legal system or government. The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus works in an industry dominated by outdated technology that is ripe for fresh thinking: our core competitors rely on massive call centers to screen clients, antiquated CRMs to track and manage cases, and paper checks to get paid (provided they’re sent to the right address). </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Conversely, as a VC-backed tech company our product &amp; engineering department powers everything we do: from creating an engaging online experience for people in crisis to providing tools for our network lawyers as they serve our clients, Atticus relies on technology to fulfill our mission.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We’re looking for Software Engineers to join our team. You’ll work on the front-end, and will partner with every department at Atticus as we continue to grow our platform to help people in need find trusted legal support. </p><h2> <strong>What You'll Do:</strong></h2><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Design, build and operate Atticus’ web applications with a focus on performance, modularity, extensibility, and reliability.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Work with product to evaluate and refine product details and acceptance criteria</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Architect, design, write, review, and test code in a collaborative environment with other software engineers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Evaluate storage technologies and methodologies with an eye toward scalability and performance.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Leverage your peers as multipliers for your skills to create excellent products and services.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">The role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup that doubles as a B-corp social enterprise. Every project you take on will help clients in need get the help they deserve, and you’ll shape our company culture as we scale. We’re looking for engineers who are excited about our mission and the challenges it entails.</p><h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">Required:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have 5+ years of experience writing idiomatic JavaScript, Golang, Java, Python, Scala, or Ruby.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have experience and love for building performant React applications</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You speak CSS and HTML fluently and know how to build around browser limitations</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You enjoy working with UI and UX experts to build compelling user experiences</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You build modern, resilient and operationally sane fullstack systems exemplifying industry standards (HTTP REST, GraphQL, Stream processing, Big Data).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You enjoy teaching and mentoring teammates on backend system best practices and architecture</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You work well with product to clarify and translate requirements for teammates</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You use a modern version-control system for your source code repository (Git, Mercurial, GitHub, BitBucket).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You lint all your code or know you should.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You know what parts of your code require tests and you write those tests.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You use objective judgment in leveraging the right frameworks and technologies.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are versed in cloud computing systems (GCP, AWS, etc.) and SAAS concepts.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You leverage continuous integration systems to their full extent (CircleCI, Bamboo, Jenkins, TravisCI).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You plan for, build, evolve and scrutinize monitoring and alerting for your production systems.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are willing and able to deploy, troubleshoot, and maintain your systems in production and staging environments.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">Bonus / Nice-to-Have:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience with Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, CircleCI, Git, Golang, Java</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience with GraphQL, GraphQL Federation, REST APIs and supporting network protocols</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience with a distributed SQL platform like CockroachDB or Google Spanner</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience with Hadoop, MapReduce, or other “Big Data” systems</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You can build a great Webpack configuration</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.</p><h2><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">15 vacation days &amp; ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">401(k) and optional HSA/FSA</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $170,000 to $200,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.</p><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers.

&lt;p&gt;Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
