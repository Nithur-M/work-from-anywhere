                <p>Bitcoin's mission is to create more 'economic freedom' in the world. We believe individuals should be able to freely acquire and use personal resources however they choose. We assert that economic freedom is a fundamental human right and a vital component of human dignity, and we believe that it is foundational for peaceful and prosperous societies.</p>

The Bitcoin.com App is a mobile and web-enabled platform from which anyone can access all Bitcoin.com products and services. Use the App to buy, sell, trade, earn, use, and learn crypto.
