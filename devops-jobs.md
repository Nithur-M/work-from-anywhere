</div><div>
<strong>Where we are and how we work:<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Our tech stack is Ansible / Ruby / PostgreSQL.<br><br>

Some of us are nomads, some just like working remotely. We highly encourage written (long-form) communication and documenting things on Notion, and generally don't like tight fixed schedules. There is not much management or oversight, we expect you to know how to manage yourself. <strong>We prioritize shipping and results above how or when you do the work.<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Two meetings per week, one for the devs on Tuesday and another one on Thursday for everyone. That's it.</strong> If you are into distributed work and prefer the lifestyle aspects or maybe live somewhere with not many exciting startups, you will enjoy working with us.<br><br>
