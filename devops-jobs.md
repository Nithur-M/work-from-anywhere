<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">Support and maintain CI/CD pipelines, including automation for build generation, testing, and deployment across multiple projects.</li>
<li style="">Assist with managing Perforce source control, including branching strategies, access, and sync issues.</li>
<li style="">Monitor, troubleshoot, and improve build stability, lighting compilation, PCV issues, and packaging workflows.</li>

<li style="">Participate in release planning and serve as a key partner during patch integration and shipping milestones.</li>
<li style="">Ensure uptime and continuity of tools and infrastructure - reducing single-point-of-failure risks and increasing build redundancy.</li>
<li style="">Proactively identify workflow bottlenecks and contribute to new tooling or automation that improves day-to-day development across the studio.</li>
<li style="">Support studio cybersecurity readiness and incident response processes as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">1–4 years of experience in a DevOps, Build Engineering, or Systems Engineering role (games or adjacent industries).</li>

<li style="">Experience with Unreal Engine.</li>
<li style="">Experience with Perforce or other VCS tools, and comfort navigating large repositories.</li>
<li style="">Familiarity with build pipelines, packaging systems, and engine-specific data compilation (e.g., lightmaps, shaders, PCVs).</li>
<li style="">Strong troubleshooting skills and a methodical approach to diagnosing and resolving technical issues.</li>
<li style="">Excellent communication and documentation skills; able to collaborate effectively with cross-disciplinary teams.</li>
<li style="">Eagerness to learn, grow, and adapt in a fast-paced, multi-project environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pluses</strong>:</p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">Experience supporting Unreal Engine build systems in a shipped game environment.</li>
<li style="">Familiarity with UGS (Unreal Game Sync), Gauntlet, or similar automated build/distribution tools.</li>
<li style="">Understanding of derived data cache (DDC) optimization and configuration.</li>
<li style="">Scripting or tool development experience in C#, Python, or similar.</li>
<li style="">Interest or experience in cybersecurity / infrastructure monitoring is a bonus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Performance Expectations:</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">Increase studio build reliability and speed, reducing bottlenecks and downtime for other departments.</li>
<li style="">Help create redundancy in DevOps support, reducing dependency on a single engineer.</li>
<li style="">Maintain clear documentation, clean build logs, and accessible tools for team-wide usage.</li>
<li style="">Proactively participate in infrastructure improvements to unlock long-term velocity across all game teams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reporting &amp; Oversight:</strong></p>
