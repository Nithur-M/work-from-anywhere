      <p>Help us shape the future of open source IT, devops, and IS, from bare metal to containers. Our goal is to revolutionise open source application and infrastructure operations.</p>
<p>We are on a mission to reshape the world of software operations, using Python and Golang for next-generation infrastructure-as-code and blazing a trail to model-driven operations. We want to enable companies to run very efficient bare metal operations for high performance computing, private cloud, data lakes and analytics. To achieve this we need to invent some new technology, and we need to build some new products. In support of that goal we hire software engineers who are passionate about quality, reliability and devops.</p>
<p>This team is part of our fully managed infrastructure operations organisation. Canonical runs many private OpenStack clouds and Kubernetes clusters for customers around the world, which enables us to improve our infra-as-code products based on our own real experience, mirroring that of our users and customers. We work in Python and Golang, creating open source operations capabilities that simplify these operations for anybody, worldwide, who is building on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Our team collaborates with product, engineering, and operations teams. Most of the work is pure open source Python software development, with some planned work in Golang. The expectation is to focus on quality, design, documentation, tests and performance.
