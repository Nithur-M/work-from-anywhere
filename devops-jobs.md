</div><div><strong><br>Who are you?</strong></div><div>
<br>You’re an experienced DevOps Engineer and SRE with a thorough understanding of the full CI/CD pipeline, and your current role just isn’t holding your attention. You’d thrive in an environment where you can take an abstract goal from idea to reality with little to no guidance including research, architectural planning, proof-of-concept implementation, and full-scale implementation. You’re an autonomous person who is able to efficiently manage any number of simultaneous initiatives with detailed clarity, and you want the freedom to work where you want, when you want, and with the kinds of projects you enjoy most. <br><br>
</div><div>
<br>In your career so far, you’ve achieved: <br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>5+ years experience in a professional cloud computing role </li>
<li>Thorough understanding of the full CI/CD pipeline</li>
<li>Expertise in at least two CI tools and two CD tools </li>
<li>Experience creating complex cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure As Code (IAC)</li>
<li>Experience with Ansible and Terraform</li>
<li>Experience deploying and maintaining multiple production-ready Kubernetes clusters</li>
<li>Experience deploying and maintaining enterprise applications to a Kubernetes cluster </li>
<li>Experience in writing Helm charts </li>
<li>Experience in writing and publishing Docker containers </li>
<li>Experience using and building GitOps workflows</li>
<li>Experience in writing Bash scripts and at least 2 programming languages in addition to Bash </li>
<li>Experience improving system reliability through implementing metrics, logs, tracing, and APM systems</li>

</div><div>
<br> </div><div><strong>Who are we?</strong></div><div>
<br>Bitovi helps companies create and deliver better software and applications. We’re driven by the desire to provide value - to our clients, to the technology community, and to our incredible team. </div><div>
<br>Every day, we design, build, and deliver a wide variety of high-profile applications built with tests, full docs, and a deployment process in place. We discuss and design architectures, review code, and research new technologies. We talk to our clients directly, guiding them through the process, identifying potential problems and unknowns, and tackling challenges.  </div><div>
<br>We help one another freely. We keep a Slack channel called ask-help and it’s used constantly. We develop new skills, build better developer tools, and work on new types of projects regularly - and take the time to present at conferences, give trainings, and run meetups. We’re huge devotees of open source, and our community of developers is second to none. </div><div>
<br>Our fully remote team consists of about 80 technology enthusiasts located around the US and Canada, as well as Brazil, UK, Algeria, and Egypt. We welcome diversity and non-traditional paths into the DevOps profession - we want the right <em>person</em>, not the right collection of tech keywords. </div><div>
