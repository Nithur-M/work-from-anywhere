&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We’re a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Although we are headquartered in Gibraltar, this is a full time, 100% remote position&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start=&quot;132&quot; data-end=&quot;135&quot;&gt;While this internship is primarily remote, selected candidates will be expected to work from our Gibraltar office on certain occasions. These in-person sessions are designed to support collaboration, mentorship, and exposure to our local operations. &lt;strong&gt;Applicants should be based in Gibraltar and be able to travel to the office when required.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Position overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This internship is an exciting opportunity for students who are still studying and eager to gain hands-on experience in the tech and platform development sector. Over the course of 2 months, you’ll have the chance to work directly with our platform team, assisting with real-world technical projects and platform management tasks. This role is perfect for students studying computer science, engineering, or a related field, who want to apply their academic knowledge to practical challenges in the fintech space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support platform operations and help resolve technical issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assist in monitoring platform performance and generating reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work alongside engineers to improve the user experience and help with platform optimizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to cross-department projects and collaborate with different teams to support platform goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skills needed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently pursuing a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, Data Engineering, or a related field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some exposure to IT and change management projects through coursework, personal projects, or previous internships is beneficial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A basic understanding of Data Management principles and an eagerness to learn about platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Cloud and its services (either through academic projects or personal interest).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good written and verbal communication skills in English, enabling effective collaboration and clear reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A logical and structured approach to problem-solving with a willingness to learn and grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work well within a team, with excellent collaboration and communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any exposure to Agile (Scrum) methodologies, either through coursework or personal interest, is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other requirements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dedicated workspace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reliable internet connection with the fastest speed possible in your area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alignment with Our Values and the Xapo Values-Driven Leadership principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why work for Xapo?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;IMPACT GLOBALLY, WORK REMOTELY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shape the Future:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; Improve lives through cutting-edge technology, work 100% remotely from anywhere in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great work-life balance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Build amazing things with a balance of autonomy and collaborative teamwork. Set your own work schedule and make use of a flexible PTO plan when you need to recharge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expect Excellence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; Collaborate, learn, and grow with a high-performance team.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Xapo, we prioritize consumer protection and adhere to regulatory requirements by ensuring that all Xapiens are accountable for upholding principles of fair treatment, transparency, and ethical conduct in their interactions with customers and stakeholders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Xapo Device Policy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Consultants joining Xapo Bank must comply with the Xapo Device Policy, which governs the use of corporate-approved laptops under Corporate-Owned, Personally Purchased Device (reimbursed up to $1,500) or Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled Device (personal device with enforced security controls).&lt;br&gt;All devices must meet security requirements, enroll in Xapo’s Mobile Device Management (MDM), and adhere to compliance rules. COPPD devices remain Xapo property with buyback options upon exit. COPED users agree to data control measures, including mandatory corporate data wipes.&lt;br&gt;Compliance with the Xapo Device Policy is mandatory for all consultants, onboarding will not proceed without adherence to the policy.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
