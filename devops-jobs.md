                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SENIOR DEVOPS ENGINEER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counterpart is a modern management &amp;amp; professional liability insurance platform for the 21st century workplace. We offer products and services to help companies align the risks and incentives of creating great organizations. Our platform is designed to measure risk more efficiently using the most advanced rating system in the industry, while also proactively mitigating the risks of our insureds. Ultimately, we provide businesses with the framework to be the best versions of themselves. That’s where you come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Senior DevOps Engineer, you will be a thought leader and prolific individual contributor to the infrastructure, dynamic data services, and tooling that we are leveraging to shape the future of insurance. You will help bridge the gap between Product, Insurance, and Data while architecting the infrastructure underneath our systems and ensuring we are prepared in production and ready to disrupt the industry. Think of the words Automation, Platform, Security, and Observability. In addition, you will interact with multiple development teams and help to set the culture, rituals, and processes that underpin a high functioning engineering team and the organization more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU WILL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some key projects we are working on. You will be a part of one or more of these objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modernize insurance application workflows&lt;/strong&gt;. We are enhancing our Django system to update and automate workflows for our Risk Engineering team. You will be responsible for migrating key parts of the UI and enhancing the backend to support the best user experience possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase efficiency with AI&lt;/strong&gt;. Collaborate with the Data and Risk Engineering teams to leverage AI across our products via a React frontend. Process documents into actionable, structured information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enable small businesses to manage HR with modern software&lt;/strong&gt;. Enhance our HR application to support its next phase of growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emerging Products&lt;/strong&gt;. Create new services to enable our Claims team to process a larger volume of complex claims across many different insurance lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standardize development processes&lt;/strong&gt;. Work with engineering leaders to create documentation, examples, and training for the wider team. Our goal is to standardize how we do work in our Python and Javascript code bases. This will have a huge impact on our quality as we grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU HAVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A passion for programming and a love of building and experimentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5+ years of experience with AWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ years of experience with Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2+ years of experience with relational databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Terraform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective communication &amp;amp; documentation skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on a remote team&lt;/li&gt;
