<strong>Where we are and how we work:<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Our tech stack is Ansible / Ruby / PostgreSQL.<br><br>

</div><div>
<strong>Two meetings per week, one for the devs on Tuesday and another one on Thursday for everyone. That's it.</strong> If you are into distributed work and prefer the lifestyle aspects or maybe live somewhere with not many exciting startups, you will enjoy working with us.<br><br>
