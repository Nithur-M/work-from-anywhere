<h1><span style="font-weight:400;">About the Palm Network</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Palm NFT Studio is one of the contributors to the Palm network. The Palm network is an Ethereum-compatible sidechain, built to serve as the foundation of a new scalable and sustainable ecosystem for NFTs. It is designed by, and for, Ethereum developers and features low gas costs and fast transaction finality. The Palm network uses the IBFT-2 consensus mechanism, a rotating Proof of Authority consensus method, in lieu of Proof of Work. This substantially reduces the computing power required and allows the Palm network to be 99% more energy-efficient than Proof of Work systems. To date, more than </span><span style="font-weight:400;">3.5</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> million NFTs have been minted on the Palm network. There are currently 1.1 million wallet addresses, over 4 million NFTs, and more than 5 million transactions.</span></p>
