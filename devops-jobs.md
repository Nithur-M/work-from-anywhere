<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Yuga Labs is a web3 company exploring big ideas in identity, ownership, utility, and interoperability to push the crypto and NFT space forward. As The Defiant recently said, "The story of Yuga Labs is one where the improbable has become reality in the blink of an eye." Since debuting with our flagship collection Bored Ape Yacht Club in April 2021, weâve created new IP for the ape ecosystem (Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Bored Ape Kennel Club), acquired other top collections (CryptoPunks and Meebits), and pulled off successful events (ApeFest) and partnerships (Rolling Stone). And we made both web3 and gaming history â the biggest NFT mint ever followed by a game demo with record-breaking synchronized player participation â  for our newest initiative, Otherside.</span></p>

<p class="c-mrkdwn__quote"><strong><br>Apply anyway.<br></strong>We believe true innovation in web3 requires diversity in perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds.

Luckily, we â and every web3 company â have the opportunity to bake necessary process and mindset shifts into our company DNA from the early days.</p>
<p class="c-mrkdwn__quote">To help build a web3 thatâs diverse and inclusive, we strive to build Yugaâs workplace to be diverse and inclusive. Not just how we do things day to day, but who does them and who decides what needs to be done.</p>
<p class="c-mrkdwn__quote">So if youâre excited about one of our roles but your resume doesnât align perfectly with the job description, please apply anyway. If youâre enthusiastic about web3 but come from an industry you think is unrelated, apply anyway. If youâre a great thinker and doer, apply anyway. The fate of web3 kiiinda depends on it.</p>
