    <div class="content-intro"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>About Status</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>The role</strong></p>
<p>DevOps is a buzzword, but it's also generic enough to encompass the breadth of tasks required in supporting development teams. There are many ways to make the lives of developers easier, and everyone has their own best way, which also means every team has their own way. There is no perfect way to make everyone happy with the same thing.</p>
<p>Supporting developers involves debugging obscure bash scripts from years ago that nobody remembers. It means biting on a piece of wood and using data formats turned programming languages like YAML to configure CI jobs. It means tracking down minute differences between releases of packages and libraries causing unexpected crashes. It means rewriting the same Dockerfile for the 5th time to allow a project to use one more obscure library. Or tracking down absurd race conditions of multi-threaded tests running in parallel on the same host. Or pulling your hair out at a bug only to realize it works fine after the CI worker host is restarted.</p>
<p>But fundamentally it means wrestling it all into submission and making it run smoothly... at least for as long as you're there.</p>
<p>If you have the guts to fight against entropy and deterioration of the reality we inhabit, then you just might also be crazy enough to enjoy the struggle while it lasts, and appreciate the eventual fruits of our labour, if you value privacy, freedom, and transparency. You might even make some money, and learn a bit from all the exceptional engineers working here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who you are</strong></p>
<p>You have strong Linux Fundamentals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distros and package managers</li>
<li>Good understanding of process management</li>

<p>You have programming experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least a few languages and showing the ability to learn</li>
<li>Bash as a minimum; Python would be helpful&nbsp;</li>

<li>Jenkins CI - Pipelines are written in Groovy</li>
<li>GitHub Actions - PR builds, mostly</li>
</ul>
<p>You have experience in Security:</p>

<li>Good understanding of OpenSSH</li>
<li>GnuPG for encryption of secrets and backups</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hljs-strong">Distributed Systems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience running Ethereum nodes</li>
<li>Knowledge of Layer 2 scaling solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>
<p>We are happy to pay in any mix of fiat/crypto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hiring process</strong></p>
