Did you know: 
Some studies indicate that the average female-identifying person will apply to a job only if they feel that they qualify for 100% of the requirements? Persons of color experience this at an even higher rate. Whereas male-identifying people will apply if they feel that they qualify for 60% or more of the requirements.
Â 
Now you (may) know something new, and we want to encourage anyone who feels that they might be qualified for the role to apply. You may be surprised!

<div>
<a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Product Managers &amp; Product Designers (along with developers &amp; UX/UI folks) to team up with the best companies on their next big thing. <br><br>After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.<br><br>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>High-paying, meaningful client missions (where you'd lead Product) with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>How to apply:<br></strong>Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack">https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack</a> + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><strong><br>What you’ll do:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to be the lead Product manager/designer for impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old-school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.</li>
<li>Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </li>
<li>You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Senior Product Managers/Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.</li>
<li>Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.</li>
<li>The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>People looking for small gigs.</li>
<li>Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.</li>
<li>Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Our long-term vision:<br></strong><a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack"><span>A·Team</span></a> is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. </div><div>
<br>To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.</div>

                <p style="min-height: 1.5em;"><strong>THE ROLE </strong></p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">UpCodes is looking for our first product manager to define and operationalize our Product process. This person will partner closely with the CEO to build a concrete roadmap to help us achieve our vision.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">One of the most challenging tasks at UpCodes is deciding what to build and exactly how to do it. We operate in a highly complex and opaque domain (regulations that are in 3D and change across time and location), so we need someone who can wrangle complexity, talk with users, and come up with sensible, simple ideas. For our first product manager, we need someone who can think strategically and isn't afraid to get their hands dirty.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">You will work closely with our users and engineering team to create hypotheses, test your assumptions, and develop specs. Given that deciding what to build and ironing out the details is one of our toughest challenges, you'll find that we have a very open environment where we encourage debate and input from lots of stakeholders.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"><strong>RESPONSIBILITIES </strong></p>
<ul style="">

<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Work with designers and subject matter experts to create specs/mocks for new features, gather internal/external feedback on them and iterate</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Come up with simple UI/UX for complex problems, grounded in user feedback and data</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Work closely with engineering to launch new features</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Study analytics to help inform product decisions</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Communicate and align our team with the strategy and rationale for new features in a logical, well-structured way</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"><strong>YOU MUST HAVE </strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">4-6 years of professional experience minimum</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">SaaS Experience</p>

<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Experience talking with users to nail the details of a feature</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Experience with managing a complex product, coming up with solutions in a structured way, using user feedback and data</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Experience writing clear, simple specs and tickets</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Effective communication / interpersonal skills</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Someone who isn’t afraid of responsibility and operating in an unstructured environment</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Strong work ethic</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">A good sense of humor and a down-to-earth personality</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Full-Time Role</strong></p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"><strong>100% remote</strong></p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"><strong>$140k-$180k + equity</strong></p>
