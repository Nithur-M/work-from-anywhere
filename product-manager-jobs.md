&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We‚Äôre a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country. This is the dream that drove Wences Casares, our Founder and Chairman, to quietly transform the world of banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Although we are headquartered in Gibraltar, this is a full time, 100% remote position&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Position overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are seeking an exceptional Product Manager for Engagement, and Subscriptions to lead the discovery and execution of initiatives that drive engagement and boost product adoption while providing a premium customer experience. As a Product Manager at our company, you will act as the CEO of your area, driving outcomes that balance member experience, business goals, and member retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide our members with a best-in-class, seamless experience across all touchpoints of their journey with our product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and execute comprehensive engagement strategies that maximize activation, retention, and subscription rates while fostering a deep connection between our members and our product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for a proactive, data-driven thinker with a passion for member-centricity and a go-getting attitude. You will navigate challenges autonomously and drive impactful solutions in a dynamic environment. This demands a hands-on approach, sharp analytical skills, and a strategic vision for your area. You‚Äôll have to independently tackle challenges while excelling in a collaborative environment across multiple domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Discovery &amp;amp; Strategy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a vision and strategy, and prioritize initiatives that drive activation, engagement and growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with members, stakeholders (including C-level), and cross-functional teams to identify challenges and opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use qualitative (e.g., user interviews) and quantitative (e.g., engagement metrics) insights to pinpoint improvement opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and implement robust A/B tests and experimentation frameworks to validate hypotheses and optimize activation, engagement and growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Execution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and optimize member journeys to maximize activation, engagement, and subscription rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead cross-functional teams (mobile/backend engineers, product designer) to plan, execute, and iterate on impactful product changes and engagement campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use data-driven insights to refine features and measure success through metrics like member activation rates, engagement levels, and subscription growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought Leadership&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act as the go-to expert in your product area, ensuring clear alignment of goals and priorities among all stakeholders. We want you to be a thought leader, both internally as well as externally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay informed and up-to-date on industry trends, best practices in user engagement, and innovative communication strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate technical concepts into user-friendly language for both internal and external communications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skills needed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ years of experience, preferably in technology-driven fintech, regtech, or digital banking companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven track record of delivering user-focused products in complex domains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical skills with experience using data analytics tools, particularly Amplitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with agile methodologies and product development processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in designing, implementing, and analyzing A/B tests or other experimental methodologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain Knowledge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise in user engagement strategies, customer retention, and subscription-based business models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep understanding of various communication channels and tools, including email marketing, push notifications, and in-app messaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with user behavior analytics, cohort analysis, and engagement metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong grasp of product lifecycle management and user journey optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of A/B testing methodologies and experimentation frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of data privacy regulations and best practices in user communications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with CRM systems and marketing automation platforms is a strong plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Skills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An entrepreneurial mindset, proactive, and you are outcome-driven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track record of successfully shipping products in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know how to drive clarity and communicate horizontally and vertically to stakeholders that have vastly different backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You make data-informed decisions and challenge the status quo using first principles thinking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A deep understanding of Agile methodologies and/or modern product management frameworks (Reforge, SVPG).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other requirements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion for Bitcoin and a strong understanding of its role in financial freedom (orange-pilled mindset preferred!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dedicated workspace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reliable internet connection with the fastest speed possible in your area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devices and other essential equipment that meet minimal technical specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alignment with Our Values and the Xapo Values-Driven Leadership principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why work for Xapo?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;IMPACT GLOBALLY, WORK REMOTELY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shape the Future:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; Improve lives through cutting-edge technology, work 100% remotely from anywhere in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great work-life balance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Build amazing things with a balance of autonomy and collaborative teamwork. Set your own work schedule and make use of a flexible PTO plan when you need to recharge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expect Excellence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; Collaborate, learn, and grow with a high-performance team. Learn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; how you learn best - from books to conferences, you‚Äôll get a yearly budget for your individual learning and development goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Xapo, we prioritize consumer protection and adhere to regulatory requirements by ensuring that all Xapiens are accountable for upholding principles of fair treatment, transparency, and ethical conduct in their interactions with customers and stakeholders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We‚Äôre a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country. This is the dream that drove Wences Casares, our Founder and Chairman, to quietly transform the world of banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Although we are headquartered in Gibraltar, this is a full time, 100% remote position&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Position overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xapo Bank is seeking an innovative expert to craft and optimize our website strategy, transforming it into a dynamic growth engine that drives traffic, engagement, and conversions while delivering an exceptional user experience. This role seamlessly blends analytical insights, backend expertise, and creative design, ensuring our website not only performs at the highest level but also aligns perfectly with the company‚Äôs ambitious objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and execute the strategy for optimizing Xapo‚Äôs website to maximize traffic, engagement, and conversions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work closely with product and engineering teams to implement and improve website analytics tracking, translating business analytics needs into technical requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply technical SEO principles to ensure optimal organic search rankings and site performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor website performance using analytics tools, making data-driven recommendations for improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create comprehensive reports on site performance, SEO performance, and key metrics to inform content and growth strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilize content management systems (CMS) to create and manage website content effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance website UI/UX to provide a sticky and engaging user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with the design team to create and integrate design elements into the website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage web analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics), CDPs (e.g., Segment), BI tools (e.g., Looker), and Google Tag Manager to track and analyze performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web development skills (e.g., HTML, JavaScript) are a plus for implementing technical changes and enhancements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skills needed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience in website management, digital marketing, or related roles in the crypto industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated expertise in website optimization, analytics, and SEO strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency with web analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Amplitude), CDPs (e.g., Segment), BI tools (e.g., Looker), and Google Tag Manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in technical SEO principles, including on-page, off-page, and backend optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical mindset with the ability to translate data insights into actionable strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in creating detailed performance reports for website and SEO metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to align website strategy with broader business objectives and growth goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working cross-functionally with product, engineering, and marketing teams to implement improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of UX/UI principles to enhance the user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other requirements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dedicated workspace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reliable internet connection with the fastest speed possible in your area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devices and other essential equipment that meet minimal technical specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alignment with Our Values and the Xapo Values-Driven Leadership principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why work for Xapo?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;IMPACT GLOBALLY, WORK REMOTELY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shape the Future:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; Improve lives through cutting-edge technology, work 100% remotely from anywhere in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great work-life balance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Build amazing things with a balance of autonomy and collaborative teamwork. Set your own work schedule and make use of a flexible PTO plan when you need to recharge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expect Excellence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; Collaborate, learn, and grow with a high-performance team. Learn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; how you learn best - from books to conferences, you‚Äôll get a yearly budget for your individual learning and development goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Xapo, we prioritize consumer protection and adhere to regulatory requirements by ensuring that all Xapiens are accountable for upholding principles of fair treatment, transparency, and ethical conduct in their interactions with customers and stakeholders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Serve as an evangelist for Fingerprint‚Äôs mobile SDK offerings, including supporting app store marketing and evangelism for our Android Device Reputation Network.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experience with customer empathy and experience shaping product direction and execution based on customer needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will figure out solutions to hard problems with constraints, using sound judgment to assess risks; strong communication skills are required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonus Points:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience product managing mobile SDKs, libraries or other products that help build security and/or identity management into mobile apps (such as Auth0, BioID, AppDome, ThreatMetrix, Zimperium, &lt;a href=&quot;http://Protectt.ai&quot;&gt;Protectt.ai&lt;/a&gt;, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience in programming languages like Swift, Objective - C, and/or Kotlin&lt;/li&gt;

In order to be compliant with local legislation, as well as to provide greater transparency to candidates, we share salary ranges on all job postings regardless of desired hiring location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including geographic location as well as candidate experience and expertise, and may vary from the amounts listed above. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there‚Äôs a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with the best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are Orderly, the ultimate destination for decentralized trading platforms. We are not satisfied with the limitations of centralized exchanges or the complexities of building decentralized order books. We aim to make trading easy, fast, and secure for everyone. How? By fusing the simplicity of CeFi with the power of DeFi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of the issue lies ‚Äúliquidity‚Äù. Builders often grapple with a paradox; traders need liquidity, but liquidity demands traders. Our solution is simple as is bold ‚Äì&lt;span class=&quot;text-primary-100 font-semibold&quot;&gt;concentrate all liquidity into one order book. One order book that connects all the liquidity in the crypto space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our ambition doesn&#39;t stop there. We&#39;re omnichain, championing chain abstraction. We envision seamless transactions, where the underlying blockchain is merely a detail. By concentrating liquidity, we aim to redefine the crypto landscape, making bridging and wrapped assets a thing of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are Orderly, and we are here to revolutionize DeFi, democratizing access to financial opportunities and fostering a fair, equitable paradigm for all.&lt;/p&gt;
