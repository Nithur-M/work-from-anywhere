                About Lyra Health
Lyra is transforming mental health care through technology with a human touch to help people feel emotionally healthy at work and at home. We work with industry leaders, such as Morgan Stanley, Uber, Amgen, and other Fortune 500 companies, to improve access to effective, high-quality mental health care for their employees and their families. With our innovative digital care platform and global provider network, 10 million people can receive the best care and feel better, faster. Founded by David Ebersman, former CFO of Facebook and Genentech, Lyra has raised more than $900 million.

About the Role
Lyra is at the forefront of increasing access to evidence-based, efficacious mental health services on a large scale. Lyra has developed innovative blended models of coaching and psychotherapy that combine leading clinical expertise with routine outcomes monitoring and engaging clinical digital tools. Scientific publications on Lyraâs mental health coaching [link, link], psychotherapy [link, link], medication management [link], and overall workforce mental health programs [link, link] provide strong evidence for the clinical effectiveness of these evidence-based treatment programs.Â 

We are looking for an experienced psychologist with a passion for writing, intervention development, and skills training to contribute to our care programs (including but not limited to our parent coaching program, other programming related to youth and families, as well as adult programs).Â  For this role, strong expertise in child externalizing behaviors and behavioral parent training is required. This position will largely be dedicated to writing on clinical topics.

You will be part of a highly skilled, creative, and collaborative team with an established track record for developing effective and engaging interventions and digital clinical materials on emotional wellness and psychotherapy skills.Â  By directly reaching tens of thousands of clients, your work on interventions and digital clinical materials will help create meaningful positive change on a large scale.Â Â 

This position can be fully remote or hybrid (i.e., 2 days onsite at our Burlingame office, 3 days from home).

Lyra Health, Inc. works in partnership with Lyra Clinical Associates P.C. and other contracted affiliates to deliver clinical services.
