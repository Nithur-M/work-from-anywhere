                <div><b style="font-size:18px;">About Acala</b></div><div><br></div><div>Acala's mission is to build and nurture the autonomous financial infrastructure of the decentralized web. Delivering on this mission will bring more financial accessibility, opportunity, and prosperity to everyone on the planet through a new, open financial system.</div><div><br></div><div>Our core project is the Acala Network itself, which we expect to become the de facto DeFi parachain and stablecoin of the Polkadot ecosystem. Polkadot provides the underlying trust primitives to our parachain, upon which weâve built our suite of financial primitives including; decentralized, multi-collateral stablecoin; trustless staking derivatives, and Decentralized Exchange. These primitives will be used by us and other teams to power open DeFi innovations, and remove the need for the intermediaries that inhabit almost every conventional trust-based financial system.</div><div><br></div><div>We have secured our support from eminent backers like Polychain, Coinbase Venture, Pantera and many more. Acala began its launch process on December 18, 2021, and we've got regular product launches and tokenomic incentive programs planned throughout 2022, so thereâs no better time to join the DeFi mission and be a part of the future that weâre building...because we're building it for you, too.</div><div><br></div><div>
