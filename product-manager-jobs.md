<h2><span style="color: #a112ff;">Who we are</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that </span><a href="https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/strategy-goals/strategy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone can code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not just ~0.1% of the population. Our code graph powers Cody, the most powerful and accurate code AI for writing, fixing, and maintaining code, as well as our Code Search product, helping devs explore their entire codebase and make large-scale migrations and security fixes. We‚Äôre building software that builds software, and in doing so we‚Äôre making devs more productive and growing the population of coders by giving anybody access to the deep knowledge base of a senior engineer through Cody and all of the context it brings. We‚Äôre preparing for a world with a lot more code than exists today, and that benefits us all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs an exciting time to join Sourcegraph. AI has taken over the world, and we‚Äôve spent the last 10 years building infrastructure that‚Äôs integral to making AI generated code more powerful and accurate. Our customers include 4/5 FAANG companies, 4 of the top 10 banks, government organizations, Uber, Plaid, and many other companies building the software that pushes the world forward.
