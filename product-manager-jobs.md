<p>Metaplex Studios is the official standard for Solana NFTs and the largest NFT ecosystem in the world. In less than one year since launch, we have experienced massive growth with over 11 million NFTs created using the Metaplex protocol, facilitating over $2.6 billion in commerce for developers and creatives of all kinds. Solana’s energy efficiency, low cost, and fast transaction speeds provide a unique opportunity now to build a future for NFTs as the infrastructure for an increasingly broad scope of use cases; it has already been used for over 85k projects in gaming, arts &amp; collectibles, marketplaces, developer tools, and more.</p>
