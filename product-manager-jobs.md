&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We‚Äôre a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Although we are headquartered in Gibraltar, this is a full time, 100% remote position&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This role seamlessly blends analytical insights, backend expertise, and creative design, ensuring our website not only performs at the highest level but also aligns perfectly with the company‚Äôs ambitious objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and execute the strategy for optimizing Xapo‚Äôs website to maximize traffic, engagement, and conversions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work closely with product and engineering teams to implement and improve website analytics tracking, translating business analytics needs into technical requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply technical SEO principles to ensure optimal organic search rankings and site performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor website performance using analytics tools, making data-driven recommendations for improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create comprehensive reports on site performance, SEO performance, and key metrics to inform content and growth strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilize content management systems (CMS) to create and manage website content effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance website UI/UX to provide a sticky and engaging user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with the design team to create and integrate design elements into the website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage web analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics), CDPs (e.g., Segment), BI tools (e.g., Looker), and Google Tag Manager to track and analyze performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web development skills (e.g., HTML, JavaScript) are a plus for implementing technical changes and enhancements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skills needed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience in website management, digital marketing, or related roles in the crypto industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated expertise in website optimization, analytics, and SEO strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency with web analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Amplitude), CDPs (e.g., Segment), BI tools (e.g., Looker), and Google Tag Manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in technical SEO principles, including on-page, off-page, and backend optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical mindset with the ability to translate data insights into actionable strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in creating detailed performance reports for website and SEO metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to align website strategy with broader business objectives and growth goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working cross-functionally with product, engineering, and marketing teams to implement improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of UX/UI principles to enhance the user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other requirements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dedicated workspace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reliable internet connection with the fastest speed possible in your area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devices and other essential equipment that meet minimal technical specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alignment with Our Values and the Xapo Values-Driven Leadership principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why work for Xapo?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;IMPACT GLOBALLY, WORK REMOTELY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

Set your own work schedule and make use of a flexible PTO plan when you need to recharge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expect Excellence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; Collaborate, learn, and grow with a high-performance team.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Xapo, we prioritize consumer protection and adhere to regulatory requirements by ensuring that all Xapiens are accountable for upholding principles of fair treatment, transparency, and ethical conduct in their interactions with customers and stakeholders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Xapo Device Policy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Consultants joining Xapo Bank must comply with the Xapo Device Policy, which governs the use of corporate-approved laptops under Corporate-Owned, Personally Purchased Device (reimbursed up to $1,500) or Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled Device (personal device with enforced security controls).&lt;br&gt;All devices must meet security requirements, enroll in Xapo‚Äôs Mobile Device Management (MDM), and adhere to compliance rules. COPPD devices remain Xapo property with buyback options upon exit. COPED users agree to data control measures, including mandatory corporate data wipes.&lt;br&gt;Compliance with the Xapo Device Policy is mandatory for all consultants, onboarding will not proceed without adherence to the policy.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Serve as an evangelist for Fingerprint‚Äôs mobile SDK offerings, including supporting app store marketing and evangelism for our Android Device Reputation Network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Bachelor&#39;s Degree in a technical discipline or equivalent work experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5+ years of experience in engineering and product management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Engineering with API management experience required (public facing API&#39;s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of mobile architectures and design principles for iOS and Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep knowledge of modern Engineering processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of mobile app security &amp;amp; privacy practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience navigating difficult situations with competing partner needs and across multiple audiences (individual contributors, managers, executives)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with customer empathy and experience shaping product direction and execution based on customer needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will figure out solutions to hard problems with constraints, using sound judgment to assess risks; strong communication skills are required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonus Points:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience product managing mobile SDKs, libraries or other products that help build security and/or identity management into mobile apps (such as Auth0, BioID, AppDome, ThreatMetrix, Zimperium, &lt;a href=&quot;http://Protectt.ai&quot;&gt;Protectt.ai&lt;/a&gt;, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience in programming languages like Swift, Objective - C, and/or Kotlin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You‚Äôve created and published at least one mobile app to Google Play or App store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have strong familiarity with Android Studio and/or iOS development tools (Xcode, CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager, CI/CD, Fastlane etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compensation Range&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;$150,000 - $200,000 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;For cash compensation, we set standard ranges for all&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;US based roles based&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on function, level and geographic location, benchmarked against similar stage growth companies. In order to be compliant with local legislation, as well as to provide greater transparency to candidates, we share salary ranges on all job postings regardless of desired hiring location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including geographic location as well as candidate experience and expertise, and may vary from the amounts listed above. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there‚Äôs a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are Orderly, the ultimate destination for decentralized trading platforms. We are not satisfied with the limitations of centralized exchanges or the complexities of building decentralized order books. We aim to make trading easy, fast, and secure for everyone. How? By fusing the simplicity of CeFi with the power of DeFi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of the issue lies ‚Äúliquidity‚Äù. Builders often grapple with a paradox; traders need liquidity, but liquidity demands traders. Our solution is simple as is bold ‚Äì&lt;span class=&quot;text-primary-100 font-semibold&quot;&gt;concentrate all liquidity into one order book. One order book that connects all the liquidity in the crypto space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our ambition doesn&#39;t stop there. We&#39;re omnichain, championing chain abstraction. We envision seamless transactions, where the underlying blockchain is merely a detail. By concentrating liquidity, we aim to redefine the crypto landscape, making bridging and wrapped assets a thing of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are Orderly, and we are here to revolutionize DeFi, democratizing access to financial opportunities and fostering a fair, equitable paradigm for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You&#39;ll collaborate with development teams to identify technical bottlenecks and feasible approaches to drive the creation of new features and products within time constraints.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You&#39;ll guide the prioritization of work, and risk analysis, help make resourcing and decide on tradeoffs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&#39;ll develop strategies and tactics to create public awareness and attraction for the vision we&#39;re building.&lt;/li&gt;
