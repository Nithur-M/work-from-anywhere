<div><strong>About Us</strong></div><div>
<br>Hi, we're Shake. Our mission is to help businesses grow with online reviews, using both 1st party reviews on your business and 3rd party reviews on other businesses. We're creating a more transparent world by helping both consumers and companies be more aware of customer feedback.</div><div>
<a href="https://www.reviewshake.com/">Reviewshake</a> is our SaaS product that helps small businesses, agencies and enterprises manage their reviews on 80+ review sites, including Facebook, Google, Yelp and Tripadvisor. As our customer base and team is increasing, we are looking for a Product Manager (remote) to lead Reviewshake. Being bootstrapped (not venture-backed) and fully remote, we don't strive for growth at all costs, and are building a company that we can be proud of, and enjoy working for.</div><div>
<br><br><strong>About You</strong><br><br>We're looking for a sharp, self-motivated, kind, problem-solving Product Manager to join our team. You'll use your experience and expertise in shipping well-designed and successful SaaS apps to help us build the right stuff. We're not short on ideas, but we do need someone that can use their own insight, connection to users, data, and knowledge of technical feasibility to make product strategy decisions. We're not looking for backlog administrators or 'project' managers. We're looking for someone that'd be capable, either now or in the future, of being the CEO at their own startup.<br><br>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Our ideal candidate has:</strong></div><ul>
<li>Prior experience with SaaS products</li>
<li>3+ years of experience building and delivering successful products. You can take rough themes and big ideas and turn them into a roadmap with minimal guidance</li>
<li>Talent for mediating challenging interests and finding creative solutions</li>
<li>Strong verbal and written English communication skills</li>
<li>An understanding of how to take highly complex data and turn it into actionable insights</li>
<li>A thirst to be challenged by enterprise-grade problems</li>
<li>A passion about every small detail in a product and always dedicated to improving your craft</li>
</ul><div>
<br><br>
</div><div><strong>Nice to have:</strong></div><ul>
<li>Being a former engineer or product designer</li>
<li>Have experience digging into data in Google Analytics or writing SQL queries</li>
<li>Have experience with data visualization</li>
</ul><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>In a typical day, you will:<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Identify customer needs and business opportunities through a combination of research, feedback collection from cross-functional teammates, and competitive data analysis</li>
<li>Define, understand, and improve key funnels and metrics</li>
<li>Write product requirement documents, making thoughtful product decisions along the way, and sharing insights and results throughout the company.</li>
<li>Communicate with our customers, either through product updates or user interviews</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Salary:</strong>
</div><ul><li>$22-$30k / year (for part-time schedule)</li></ul>

<div>
<a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Product Managers &amp; Product Designers (along with developers &amp; UX/UI folks) to team up with the best companies on their next big thing. <br><br>After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.<br><br>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>High-paying, meaningful client missions (where you'd lead Product) with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>How to apply:<br></strong>Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack">https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack</a> + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><strong><br>What you’ll do:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to be the lead Product manager/designer for impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old-school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.</li>
<li>Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </li>
<li>You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Senior Product Managers/Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.</li>
<li>Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.</li>
<li>The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>People looking for small gigs.</li>
<li>Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.</li>
<li>Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Our long-term vision:<br></strong><a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack"><span>A·Team</span></a> is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. </div><div>
<br>To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.</div>
