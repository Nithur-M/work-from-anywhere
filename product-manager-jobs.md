We are also deeply committed to open-source contributions and fostering a vibrant community.

&lt;p&gt;We’re a team of 200+ globally distributed members who love working from our favorite places worldwide. Our team spans the USA, Canada, Japan, Hungary, Nigeria, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for candidates eager to join Alpaca’s growing organization, who are excited about our Mission of “Open financial services to everyone on the planet and share our Values of “Stay Curious,” “Have Empathy,” and “Be Accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Role:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpaca is looking for a Product Manager with deep experience around global and local payment rails, to lead our various payment initiatives. You will play a crucial role in developing and enhancing our vision towards a global financial platform, and provide seamless solutions to help grow our partners to integrate with Alpaca’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own and execute the end-to-end product strategy and roadmap for Alpaca’s global funding infrastructure, encompassing all inbound and outbound payment flows for our users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify, evaluate, and lead the integration of new local and alternative payment methods in international markets. You will own the business case for expansion and the execution of new rail integrations from discovery to launch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the product requirements for our public-facing Payments and Funding APIs and the underlying internal systems. You will champion a world-class experience for our developer partners, ensuring our APIs are scalable, reliable, and well-documented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with engineering, design, finance, and operations teams to deliver high-quality solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct market research and competitive analysis to identify opportunities and inform product decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instrument, analyze, and own KPIs for the payments funnel—including conversion rates, cost-per-transaction, settlement times, and error rates. You will use this data to drive the prioritization roadmap and communicate impact to stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage the product lifecycle from conception to launch and beyond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and manage relationships with banks and payment rail vendors to discover the best solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate product vision and strategy to stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bachelor&#39;s degree in Computer Science, or equivalent professional experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience within the payments ecosystem, including a deep understanding of payment processing, cross-border transactions, and global payment methods (e.g., ACH, SEPA, wires, local bank transfers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of global and local payment processing, regulations, and technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work effectively in a fast-paced and collaborative environment.&lt;/li&gt;
