<h2><span style="color: #a112ff;">Who we are</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that </span><a href="https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/strategy-goals/strategy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone can code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not just ~0.1% of the population. Our code graph powers Cody, the most powerful and accurate code AI for writing, fixing, and maintaining code, as well as our Code Search product, helping devs explore their entire codebase and make large-scale migrations and security fixes. We’re building software that builds software, and in doing so we’re making devs more productive and growing the population of coders by giving anybody access to the deep knowledge base of a senior engineer through Cody and all of the context it brings. We’re preparing for a world with a lot more code than exists today, and that benefits us all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an exciting time to join Sourcegraph. AI has taken over the world, and we’ve spent the last 10 years building infrastructure that’s integral to making AI generated code more powerful and accurate. Our customers include 4/5 FAANG companies, 4 of the top 10 banks, government organizations, Uber, Plaid, and many other companies building the software that pushes the world forward.

Ideally, you will define a compelling vision at the center of our unique differentiation, an untapped part of the market, and something our customers are willing to pay for. You will be the go-to for defining&nbsp; a crucial member of our exceptional<a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/values#high-agency"> high agency</a><a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/remote"> all-remote team</a>, and will help us to achieve ambitious objectives to build a code intelligence platform.</p>

<h2><span style="color: rgb(140, 51, 236);">About you</span>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>As a Product Manager, you’re the storyteller of the organization, pulling together the story of “why”, and getting people excited about growth and what your team is doing.

You are organized, results driven and provide clarity across the organization and your team, to help inspire focus and reinforce that they are working on the right things. You are constantly curious - wanting to dig into the data, discover optimization opportunities to get our users to value faster. You can identify root causes of friction and devise experiments to address them.
