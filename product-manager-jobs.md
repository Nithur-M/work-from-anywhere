Our company is growing and we are looking for a Product Manager to lead our discovery and development initiatives related to our product expansion, and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>The Product Team</strong></p>
<p>We are an interdisciplinary team made of product managers, UX designers and data analysts. We are a growing team of 12, with most people joining in 2021. The team is small enough that everyone has a few hats to wear, but large enough that we have experts who can guide the rest of the team in their area, such as User Research, User Experience or Analytics. Some of us come from a teaching background, or marketing, engineering, QA and more disciplines, which gives the team its unique flavour. </p>
<p>Our team's mission is to <em>explore the future of Overleaf through data, design and research</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding the Business:</strong> </p>
<ul> <li>Develop and manage a solid product roadmap for your core area.</li> <li>Map opportunities and manage input from your stakeholders to enhance our offering on an ongoing basis.</li> <li>Clearly communicate our roadmap and product changes in advance of their launch and help them manage communications to customers.</li> <li>Take part in customer onboarding sessions, webinars and/or sales negotiations and use these opportunities to conduct user research.</li> </ul>
