<div class="h3">Metaplex Studios</div>
<p>Metaplex Studios is the official standard for Solana NFTs and the largest NFT ecosystem in the world. In less than one year since launch, we have experienced massive growth with over 11 million NFTs created using the Metaplex protocol, facilitating over $2.6 billion in commerce for developers and creatives of all kinds. Solana’s energy efficiency, low cost, and fast transaction speeds provide a unique opportunity now to build a future for NFTs as the infrastructure for an increasingly broad scope of use cases; it has already been used for over 85k projects in gaming, arts &amp; collectibles, marketplaces, developer tools, and more.</p>
<p>On a mission to empower creators, Metaplex champions a world full of diverse perspectives, creativity and art. For this to be possible, creators must have increased access to their audience, powerful tools that are easy to use, and be able to retain more financial benefits from the sales and use of their work. We believe tokens and blockchain technology are a critical tool for this purpose. For more information, visit <a class="external" href="http://www.metaplex.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.metaplex.com</a></p>
<p>The Protocol Team works to increase use of the Metaplex NFT standard and Program Library by adding high value features developed by our team and the community, and by scaling and optimizing those features over time.

                <p style="min-height: 1.5em;">We heard you might be looking for a new opportunity! Cartloop might be the perfect stop for you. Just in case you haven't heard, growing an ecommerce brand often equals automating human communication. But automation means losing a key piece of the shopping experience: a real connection with people.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Cartloop is an ecommerce startup that's changing the way people and businesses interact. Instead of purely automated messages (or chatbots), we are helping brands grow by adding human touch throughout the entire shopping experience. The coolest thing is we are growing quickly and possibly have the perfect position for you.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<div class="h2"><strong>Team and culture</strong></div>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Cartloop is helping brands win the hearts of their customers by providing a tool that creates personal relationships at scale. To provide a missing pillar of core eCommerce experience, we're building a team of people who are ready to take on some of the most interesting challenges in the industry.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Here are some of our core values to give you a sense of who we are as a team:</p>
<ul style="min-height: 1.5em;">
