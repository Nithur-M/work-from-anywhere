<div>
<a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Product Managers &amp; Product Designers (along with developers &amp; UX/UI folks) to team up with the best companies on their next big thing. <br><br>After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.<br><br>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>High-paying, meaningful client missions (where you'd lead Product) with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>How to apply:<br></strong>Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack">https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack</a> + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><strong><br>What you’ll do:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to be the lead Product manager/designer for impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old-school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.</li>
<li>Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </li>
<li>You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Senior Product Managers/Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.</li>
<li>Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.</li>
<li>The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>People looking for small gigs.</li>
<li>Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.</li>
<li>Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Our long-term vision:<br></strong><a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack"><span>A·Team</span></a> is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. </div><div>
<br>To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.</div>

<p>Knoetic (rhymes with “poetic”!) has built the world’s #1 social network of Chief People Officers, which includes the CPOs of Lyft, Dropbox, and Bumble and 1,000 more. And we’ve built a people analytics platform used by most of the hyper-growth tech companies of our generation, including:</p>

<p>But what’s really exciting is what’s to come - delivering the grand vision of a people “decision engine” that helps (a) companies use data to make better decisions on compensation, diversity, retention, and (b) employees make better decisions about their career.</p>
<p>You have to see it for yourself :)</p>
<p>We’re a rapidly growing <a href="%22https:/www.knoetic.com/blog/series-b%22" rel="nofollow" target='"_blank"'>$36M Series B company</a> backed with $50MM+ from legendary investors including EQT, Accel, Menlo, NYT bestselling author Adam Grant, and 100+ founders and executives from companies like Mozilla, Heap, Google, Pinterest, and more.

<p><strong>Knoetic is hiring a Senior/Lead Product Manager for our People Analytics team who is truly exceptional at their craft. You'll be our conductor that keeps things running smoothly, and an ethnographer uncovering what our customers need (and why). Together with your team of super-stars, you will execute our highly ambitious vision: to build the world’s #1 platform for top Chief People Officers and their People teams.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you're a product manager that aspires to build products wicked fast, delights products with strong user intuition, and strives for amazing execution - we want to speak with you!</strong></p>
<div class="h2">What you'll do</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Execute on the product vision</strong>, working to translate high-level strategy into execution and delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Be our quarterback</strong>, facilitating collaboration that helps create great products and helping bring together our engineering, design, sales, and community teams.</li>
<li><strong>Become an expert on our customers and our market</strong>, helping to lead customer calls, sales conversations, and quantitative and qualitative user research.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure the trains run on time</strong>, leading the product development process in an agile and fast-paced environment (1-2 week sprints).</li>
</ul>
<div class="h2">Who you are</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>At least 5 years of Product Management experience</strong> (bonus points if you’re working on analytics/community-related products).</li>
<li><strong>Detail-Oriented: </strong>Must be comfortable asking hard questions and taking things to a very granular level. You should not be afraid of going 4-5 layers deep into a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic: </strong>Must be comfortable zooming out when needed and making very critical decisions to drive development forward.</li>
<li><strong>Ownership &amp; Accountability:</strong> You have complete clarity on goals, break down projects monthly/weekly/daily and even hourly if needed. You stick to your commitments and work backwards to make sure you execute on time.</li>
<li><strong>You are a process machine</strong>, rigorous about creating and enforcing processes that help teams execute.</li>
<li><strong>You’re a doer</strong>, equally comfortable writing a thoughtful PRD as you are getting on the phone to understand a customer issue or help close a deal.</li>
<li><strong>You can see the big picture, but are also obsessed with the smallest details</strong>. Your quality bar is insanely high, and you won’t be satisfied unless you ship an A++ user experience.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>You like to win</strong>. You don’t want a trophy for effort, you want it for first place.</li>

<li><strong>You never say, “that’s not my job”</strong> - you take full ownership and responsibility over outcomes. You’re a force of nature that gets the job done no matter what it takes.</li>
<li><strong>You make everyone else on the team better</strong>. Your presence, positivity, and drive inspires others to step up their game. You put the company above your own wants.</li>
<li><strong>You’re known for your work ethic</strong>. You pride yourself on being one of the hardest-working person most people know.</li>
<li><strong>You’re constantly improving.</strong> You know there’s no such thing as perfection, and you’re always pushing yourself (and our company) to be better than you were yesterday.</li>
<li><strong>You’re just good:</strong> You’re honest, principled, smart, open to giving/receiving feedback, and focused on doing right for the company and doing right for the customer</li>

<div class="h3">Knoetic cultural values</div>
<p><em>Written by our founder in 2020.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Intellectual curiosity:</strong> I want to surround myself with people who are endlessly curious, who are always asking questions, who are fascinated with understanding others and the world around them. We’re the kids who grew up always asking “Why?”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Intellectual humility:</strong> I want to work with people who embrace the scientific method, who go into conversations with an open mind and ear, who are looking for ways to sharpen their thinking, who are delighted to find out when they’re wrong rather than invested in defending why they’re right.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Relentless resourcefulness:</strong> Our company should be full of people who will run through walls to get to their goals, who will bring more solutions than problems to others, who will figure out a way to succeed no matter what.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Winning:</strong> We are ambitious, and we want to win. We don’t want a trophy for effort or for “good enough” - we want it for first place</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Positive impact on others:</strong> There are people, who by the very virtue of their presence, make everyone else around them a better person. It could be because they have unwaveringly high standards. Or are incredible givers that inspire generosity. Or are teachers of their peers. However they do it, they push others upwards. They are culture accretive; their very presence makes everyone else step up their game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Speed:</strong> We’re a team with a bias for action (paired with good judgment), a desire to get more done faster, because we know it’s the only way we’ll win. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Positivity:</strong> You know it when you see it - can-do, optimistic. That doesn’t mean everyone doesn’t have down moments - it just means on balance, you walk away from your interactions with them energized and charged up to do more with your life.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> We’re always making ourselves better. Stasis is the enemy… if you’re not going forwards, you’re going backwards. Everything is a work-in-progress in perpetuity - yourself included.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note - even if you don’t check every box in the job description, we still encourage you to apply!</strong></p>
