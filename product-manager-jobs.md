                &lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 900;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere, impact everywhere&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We’re a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country. This is the dream that drove Wences Casares, our Founder and Chairman, to quietly transform the world of banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Although we are headquartered in Gibraltar, this is a full time, 100% remote position&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Product Manager for Treasury and Corporate Accounts at Xapo Bank, you will play a pivotal role in optimizing the deployment of funds for our internal Treasury team. You will lead product discovery and MVP development for a new corporate account offering that acts like a treasury account. This role involves close collaboration with cross-functional teams to ensure the successful launch and continuous improvement of our treasury and corporate account products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treasury Optimization. &lt;/strong&gt;Our Treasury team is the heartbeat of how we earn. You’ll work closely with the Treasury team to understand their needs and optimize fund deployment strategies - developing tools and processes to enhance our treasury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Discovery and Development.&lt;/strong&gt; Lead extensive product discovery for corporate accounts that function like treasury accounts. Define MVP features and the creation of a potential roadmap moving forward.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Research and Analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; Conduct in-depth market research to identify trends, customer needs, and opportunities for product innovation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Development Support.&lt;/strong&gt; Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including your tech lead, developers, our treasury function and others to create comprehensive product requirements, user stories, and feature prioritisation. You’ll coordinate with legal, compliance, and risk management teams as well to ensure successful launches and adherence to regulatory standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Testing and Quality Assurance. &lt;/strong&gt;Ensure rigorous testing and quality assurance for new product releases and feature updates. Maintain high standards of performance, security, and reliability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance Monitoring and Analysis. &lt;/strong&gt;Track key performance indicators (KPIs), user engagement metrics, and customer feedback to identify areas for improvement and drive product optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional Development.&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll have to stay updated on the latest trends and technologies in fintech, blockchain, and cryptocurrency markets to continuously enhance your knowledge and skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skills needed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience in product management, preferably within fintech, banking, or cryptocurrency markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent analytical, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to collaborate effectively in a global, multicultural environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detail-oriented with strong organizational and project management abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with market research, data analysis, and performance monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of treasury management and corporate banking is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other requirements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dedicated workspace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reliable internet connection with the fastest speed possible in your area.&lt;/li&gt;
