                <div><b>About Decentraland</b></div><div>Decentraland is the world’s first fully decentralized, Ethereum blockchain-based virtual social world, built, governed and owned by its users. It’s a truly unique ecosystem with its own decentralized autonomous organization, currency, marketplace and system of property – and it’s growing fast! New creations are added daily by creators who use both open source and proprietary developer tools to make games, puzzles, scenes, artworks – whatever their imaginations allow. Via their personal avatars, users attend live music events, conferences, exhibitions, dance parties and other experiences every day of the year. What began as a proof-of-concept for assigning ownership of digital real estate to users of a blockchain is now an immersive, ever-expanding and richly detailed metaverse, where the world is what you make it.</div><div>Check it out at: <a class="postings-link" href="https://decentraland.org/" rel="nofollow">https://decentraland.org/</a></div><div><br></div><div><b>The challenge</b></div><div>We are actively seeking an experienced Product Manager to join our fully remote team to shape the tools that power the metaverse, helping creators monetize their content.
