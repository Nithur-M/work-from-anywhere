&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We’re a fully distributed team of over 180 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Although we are headquartered in Gibraltar, this is a full time, 100% remote position&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Position overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are seeking an exceptional Product Manager for Engagement, and Subscriptions to lead the discovery and execution of initiatives that drive engagement and boost product adoption while providing a premium customer experience. As a Product Manager at our company, you will act as the CEO of your area, driving outcomes that balance member experience, business goals, and member retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide our members with a best-in-class, seamless experience across all touchpoints of their journey with our product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and execute comprehensive engagement strategies that maximize activation, retention, and subscription rates while fostering a deep connection between our members and our product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for a proactive, data-driven thinker with a passion for member-centricity and a go-getting attitude. You will navigate challenges autonomously and drive impactful solutions in a dynamic environment. This demands a hands-on approach, sharp analytical skills, and a strategic vision for your area. You’ll have to independently tackle challenges while excelling in a collaborative environment across multiple domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Discovery &amp;amp; Strategy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a vision and strategy, and prioritize initiatives that drive activation, engagement and growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with members, stakeholders (including C-level), and cross-functional teams to identify challenges and opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use qualitative (e.g., user interviews) and quantitative (e.g., engagement metrics) insights to pinpoint improvement opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and implement robust A/B tests and experimentation frameworks to validate hypotheses and optimize activation, engagement and growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Execution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and optimize member journeys to maximize activation, engagement, and subscription rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead cross-functional teams (mobile/backend engineers, product designer) to plan, execute, and iterate on impactful product changes and engagement campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use data-driven insights to refine features and measure success through metrics like member activation rates, engagement levels, and subscription growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought Leadership&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act as the go-to expert in your product area, ensuring clear alignment of goals and priorities among all stakeholders. We want you to be a thought leader, both internally as well as externally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay informed and up-to-date on industry trends, best practices in user engagement, and innovative communication strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate technical concepts into user-friendly language for both internal and external communications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skills needed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid previous experience, preferably in technology-driven fintech, regtech, or digital banking companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven track record of delivering user-focused products in complex domains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical skills with experience using data analytics tools, particularly Amplitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with agile methodologies and product development processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in designing, implementing, and analyzing A/B tests or other experimental methodologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain Knowledge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise in user engagement strategies, customer retention, and subscription-based business models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep understanding of various communication channels and tools, including email marketing, push notifications, and in-app messaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with user behavior analytics, cohort analysis, and engagement metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong grasp of product lifecycle management and user journey optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of A/B testing methodologies and experimentation frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of data privacy regulations and best practices in user communications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with CRM systems and marketing automation platforms is a strong plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Skills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An entrepreneurial mindset, proactive, and you are outcome-driven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track record of successfully shipping products in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know how to drive clarity and communicate horizontally and vertically to stakeholders that have vastly different backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You make data-informed decisions and challenge the status quo using first principles thinking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A deep understanding of Agile methodologies and/or modern product management frameworks (Reforge, SVPG).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other requirements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion for Bitcoin and a strong understanding of its role in financial freedom (orange-pilled mindset preferred!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dedicated workspace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reliable internet connection with the fastest speed possible in your area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devices and other essential equipment that meet minimal technical specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alignment with Our Values and the Xapo Values-Driven Leadership principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why work for Xapo?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;IMPACT GLOBALLY, WORK REMOTELY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

Set your own work schedule and make use of a flexible PTO plan when you need to recharge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expect Excellence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; Collaborate, learn, and grow with a high-performance team. Learn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; how you learn best - from books to conferences, you’ll get a yearly budget for your individual learning and development goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Xapo, we prioritize consumer protection and adhere to regulatory requirements by ensuring that all Xapiens are accountable for upholding principles of fair treatment, transparency, and ethical conduct in their interactions with customers and stakeholders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Xapo Device Policy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Consultants joining Xapo Bank must comply with the Xapo Device Policy, which governs the use of corporate-approved laptops under Corporate-Owned, Personally Purchased Device (reimbursed up to $1,500) or Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled Device (personal device with enforced security controls).&lt;br&gt;All devices must meet security requirements, enroll in Xapo’s Mobile Device Management (MDM), and adhere to compliance rules.
