<strong>About BuildBook</strong><br><br>
</div><div>Home remodeling and construction projects are often a stressful and painful experience – but it doesn’t have to be that way. BuildBook is on a mission to eliminate that stress and bring joy back to home improvement – for everyone involved.</div><div><br></div><div>BuildBook is the best construction management platform for home remodelers and builders. Our goal is to become the default choice for the over 550,000 small businesses focused on residential construction and remodeling. It’s a $540B dollar a year industry, and we plan to make a dent in it by creating the best product in the space. </div><div><br></div><div>Builders love us because we give them simple, powerful tools to run their business and help them keep their clients happy. Homeowners love us because we give them a feeling of control and help make renovations and new home builds less stressful.</div><div><br></div><div>We are a remote-first startup with team members all across the US. We have a small, tight-knit team, a solid product that is gaining momentum daily, and big plans for the future. As an early member of the product team, your work is going to have a major impact on the future of the product and company. You’ll ship your work often and see its impact in the hands of real people every day.</div><div>
<br><strong>About the Job</strong>
</div><div><br></div><div>As a Senior Product Manager, you will lead teams and contribute directly to the success of our pro-facing product in addition to participating in strategic discussions that define the company’s roadmap and trajectory. </div><div><br></div><div>You’ll work directly with the Head of Product &amp; Design to help prioritize, plan and execute our product roadmap, and as an early member of the product team, you’ll have a lot of opportunity for growth both as an individual contributor and/or as a leader. </div><div><br></div><div>You’ll be responsible for helping to define the product roadmap, managing agile sprints and team communications, driving the QA process, and running a tight build-measure-learn development cycle.

You’ll partner closely with engineering to ensure the most impactful ideas are scoped, built, tested, deployed, and iterated on. </div><div><br></div><div>You’ll have plenty of support along the way, working very collaboratively with the entire team – but you’ll also have the freedom to focus and execute on deep work, which we prioritize over meetings.</div><div><br></div><div>On a given day, you might be focused on shaping up a roadmap of features to work on, pitching your own ideas, chatting with a customer to understand their workflow, or providing feedback on a feature that the engineering team is working on. </div><div>
<br><strong>In your first 60 days, you will: </strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Hit the ground running: Manage the in-flight priorities across multiple platforms (web and mobile) with existing commitments and deadlines</li>
<li>Become familiar with our backlog and roadmap, and lead your team’s sprint process</li>
<li>Establish backlog grooming, prioritization, and management cadence</li>
<li>Work across Engineering, Sales, and Marketing to gather stakeholder requirements </li>
<li>Write clear product requirements and desired project outcomes</li>
<li>Scope and validate roadmap features, so they are ready to tackle in upcoming sprints</li>
<li>Get acclimated with available business and customer data and start drawing inferences and conclusions that inform product decisions</li>
<li>Research and deeply understand our customer by interviewing a few, and understanding their workflows and needs. </li>
<li>Know the competition’s features, offerings, value propositions – and help BuildBook maintain its unique edge in the industry</li>
<li>Manage quality assurance process, including feature testing, regression, and release support.</li>
</ul><div>

</ul><div><em>Empathy</em></div><ul>
<li>You develop informed insights about our customers (builders, contractors, and remodelers), and can speak passionately about their needs and problems.</li>
<li>You are a helpful partner to your teammates in design, engineering, marketing, and leadership, you communicate with positivity, and focus on solutions.</li>
</ul><div><em>Discipline</em></div><ul>
<li>You are a manager of one: You take ownership, set direction, make calls, and get projects across the finish line without a lot of oversight.</li>
<li>You clarify goals, prioritize ruthlessly, course correct when needed, and deliver work quickly and confidently.</li>
<li>Your written communication is clear, concise, and effective, and you keep conversations moving forward through the development pipeline</li>

<p><em>Please note: All roles at Rhino are remote-first, and there will be no future in-office mandate.</em></p>
<p>Our mission is to give renters everywhere greater financial freedom to plan and enjoy their lives.</p>
<p>Our first product eliminates cash security deposits and puts more money back in renters’ pockets. With over $45 billion tied up in security deposits for 110 million renters in the United States alone, it’s time for security deposits to officially become a thing of the past. Tying up money at one of life’s biggest and most expensive moments just isn’t fair.</p>
<p>So we threw out the antiquated “way of doing things” and built a technology-driven insurance product to help bring renting into the 21st century. With Rhino, millions of renters across the country now have the opportunity to save with our award-winning deposit insurance. We’ve already saved hundreds of millions of dollars for renters and are trusted in over 2.4 million homes nationwide, and most importantly, we’re just getting started…</p>
