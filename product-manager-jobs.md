</div><div>
<strong>🌟 The Opportunity<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<br>Together with the Senior Product leadership (CPO, VP Product, etc.), this enthusiastic global Product team is defining our product vision and roadmap. <br><br>
</div><div>commercetools for Growth is a newly created solution (and team) that will enable Scaling Brands &amp; Merchants to quickly launch on a flexible, best-in-class composable stack with low effort and without the need for a big development team, keeping their iteration speed high to optimize business outcomes. The key to achieving this is to build a bundle of market-leading MACH products (commercetools products and partner products) that are perfectly connected and pre-configured. This will enable Scaling Brand and Merchants to launch quickly, iterate fast through business-user tooling and make sure that this is the last re-platforming they will ever have to do. <br><br>
</div><div>This is a great opportunity to marshal a product that has the potential to have a long-lasting impact on the commerce landscape for aspiring brands and retailers. If you are looking for a place where your contribution makes a difference, and if you never want to stop learning and growing, join our product management team!<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><strong><br>🚀 Your Mission<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Design and improve the vision and implementation of the actual bundle of MACH products that form commercetools for Growth</li>
<li>Make sure (together with engineering), that the technical architecture of the commercetools for Growth bundle is best-in-class</li>
<li>Own the connectors between the MACH products in the bundle from a product perspective</li>
<li>Lead initiatives to enhance the experience of customer interaction with such a bundled solution (e.g. SSO, business user interface, etc.)</li>
<li>In the end, build the core of the commercetools for Growth solution, so the “Fast-Launch-Store team” (second team in commercetools for Growth) can take the bundle and pre-configure it and enhance it to enable the customers to launch faster and faster</li>
<li>Think big, scope small, and quickly iterate collectively with your team to make sure that you solve the right problems</li>
<li>Use your product sense, collectively with a qualitative and data-informed approach to creating a solution brands and retailers love</li>
<li>Become part of our product community. We like to grow and learn together, including regular knowledge exchange sessions plus coaching from peers and the Head of Product.<br><br>
</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>
<strong>👉 What is it like working in our team?<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<strong>”</strong><em>We focus on solving customers' problems. To do that, we have to constantly learn new things. We have to rely on each other, trust each other, and know each other's strengths. The way we work together as a team makes this seem easy and gives a true sense of collaboration</em><strong>.” — Catherine, Product Manager<br><br></strong><br>
