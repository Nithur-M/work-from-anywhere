&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We’re a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country. This is the dream that drove Wences Casares, our Founder and Chairman, to quietly transform the world of banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Translate regulatory requirements into best-in-class, user-friendly experiences that align with compliance standards and best practices in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use data-driven insights to refine features and measure success through metrics like onboarding completion rates and false positives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought Leadership&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act as the go-to expert in your product area, ensuring clear alignment of goals and priorities among all stakeholders. We want you to be a thought leader, both internally as well as externally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A deep understanding of Agile methodologies and/or modern product management frameworks (Reforge, SVPG).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other requirements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Set your own work schedule and make use of a flexible PTO plan when you need to recharge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expect Excellence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; Collaborate, learn, and grow with a high-performance team. Learn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; how you learn best - from books to conferences, you’ll get a yearly budget for your individual learning and development goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Xapo, we prioritize consumer protection and adhere to regulatory requirements by ensuring that all Xapiens are accountable for upholding principles of fair treatment, transparency, and ethical conduct in their interactions with customers and stakeholders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tanner Hackett, CEO &amp;amp; Founder&lt;/strong&gt;: Having founded two other major startups, including Button and Lazada, Tanner now spends his time focused on mental health through his philanthropy,&lt;a href=&quot;http://openminded.org&quot;&gt; Openminded.org&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to reading, surfing, yoga, and enjoying the outdoors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

He has since helped to launch numerous businesses in which he held a variety of critical roles from product management to business operations to strategic partnerships. Chris received his bachelor’s degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Southern California.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Levins, Head of Insurance&lt;/strong&gt;: Mike previously was the Head of Broker Relations and US MGA Operations at Hiscox.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT WE OFFER:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully remote workplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Time Off&lt;/strong&gt;: We offer flexible time off, allowing you to take time when you need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work from Anywhere: Counterpart is a fully distributed company, meaning there is no office. We allow employees to work from wherever they do their best work, and invite the team to meet in person a couple of times per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wellness Stipend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health, Dental, and Vision Coverage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;401(k) Retirement Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental Leave&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Office Allowance&lt;/strong&gt;: to set up your home office with the necessary equipment and accessories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book stipend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wellness stipend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional Development Reimbursement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No working birthdays&lt;/strong&gt;: Take your birthday off, giving you the opportunity to relax, enjoy your special day, and spend time with loved ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charitable Contribution Matching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COUNTERPART&#39;S VALUES:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conjoin Expectations&lt;/strong&gt; - it is the cornerstone of autonomy. Ensure you are aware of what is expected of you and clearly articulate what you expect of others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speak Boldly &amp;amp; Honestly&lt;/strong&gt; - the only failure is not learning from mistakes. Don’t cheat yourself and your colleagues of the feedback needed when&amp;nbsp; expectations aren’t being met.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Entrepreneurial&lt;/strong&gt; - control your own destiny.&amp;nbsp; Embrace action over perfection while navigating any obstacles that stand in the way of your ultimate goal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Omotenashi&lt;/strong&gt; (“selfless hospitality”) - trust will follow.&amp;nbsp; Consider every interaction with internal and external partners an opportunity to develop trust by going above and beyond what is expected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hold Nothing As Sacred&lt;/strong&gt; - create routines but modify them routinely.&amp;nbsp; Take the time to reflect on where the business is today, where it needs to&amp;nbsp; go, and what you have to change in order to get there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Wellness&lt;/strong&gt; - some things should never be sacrificed. We create an environment that stretches everyone to grow and improve, which is fulfilling, but is only one part of a meaningful life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our estimated pay range for this role is $150,000 to $175,000. Base salary is determined by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, market data, location, internal equitability, and experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to being a welcoming and inclusive workplace for everyone, and we are intentional about making sure people feel respected, supported and connected at work—regardless of who you are or where you come from. We value and celebrate our differences and we believe being open about who we are allows us to do the best work of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are an Equal Opportunity Employer. We do not discriminate against qualified applicants or employees on the basis of race, color, religion, gender identity, sex, sexual preference, sexual identity, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, military status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law, rule, or regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
