<strong>üåü The Opportunity<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<br>Together with the Senior Product leadership (CPO, VP Product, etc.), this enthusiastic global Product team is defining our product vision and roadmap.¬†<br><br>
</div><div>commercetools for Growth is a newly created solution (and team) that will enable Scaling Brands &amp; Merchants to quickly launch on a flexible, best-in-class composable stack with low effort and without the need for a big development team, keeping their iteration speed high to optimize business outcomes. The key to achieving this is to build a bundle of market-leading MACH products (commercetools products and partner products) that are perfectly connected and pre-configured. This will enable Scaling Brand and Merchants to launch quickly, iterate fast through business-user tooling and make sure that this is the last re-platforming they will ever have to do.¬†<br><br>
</div><div>This is a great opportunity to marshal a product that has the potential to have a long-lasting impact on the commerce landscape for aspiring brands and retailers.

<li>In the end, build the core of the commercetools for Growth solution, so the ‚ÄúFast-Launch-Store team‚Äù (second team in commercetools for Growth) can take the bundle and pre-configure it and enhance it to enable the customers to launch faster and faster</li>
<li>Think big, scope small, and quickly iterate collectively with your team to make sure that you solve the right problems</li>
<li>Use your product sense, collectively with a qualitative and data-informed approach to creating a solution brands and retailers love</li>
<li>Become part of our product community. We like to grow and learn together, including regular knowledge exchange sessions plus coaching from peers and the Head of Product.<br><br>
