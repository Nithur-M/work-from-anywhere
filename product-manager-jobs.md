<div>
<a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Product Managers &amp; Product Designers (along with developers &amp; UX/UI folks) to team up with the best companies on their next big thing. <br><br>After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.<br><br>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>High-paying, meaningful client missions (where you'd lead Product) with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>How to apply:<br></strong>Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack">https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack</a> + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><strong><br>What you’ll do:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to be the lead Product manager/designer for impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old-school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.</li>
<li>Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </li>
<li>You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Senior Product Managers/Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.</li>
<li>Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.</li>
<li>The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>People looking for small gigs.</li>
<li>Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.</li>
<li>Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Our long-term vision:<br></strong><a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack"><span>A·Team</span></a> is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. </div><div>
<br>To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.</div>

<h3><strong>Databases are the beating heart of every business in the world</strong></h3>
<p>What you build and where it takes you shouldn't be limited by the capabilities of your database. We created CockroachDB to be the most highly evolved, cloud-native, distributed SQL database on the planet. Making scale so simple, you don't even have to think about it. Making data so resilient, it becomes impossible to destroy. Making delivery so seamless, your apps run anywhere. Join us on our mission to build a different breed of database—one born in the cloud and built from the ground up to help companies of any size scale fast, survive disaster, and thrive everywhere.</p>
<h3><strong>About the Role</strong></h3>
<p>We are looking for a Lead Product Manager to build an excellent developer experience for our cloud-native distributed SQL database. You will lead the SQL teams that include the SQL Sessions (e.g., connection experience, drivers/ORMs), SQL Schema (e.g., online schema changes, schema design), and SQL Queries (e.g., performance, correctness).</p>
<p>You will also own the end-to-end user journeys and user experience for SQL Queries, including performance (e.g., HTAP, OLAP), multi-region access patterns, and own the platform layers that include the Cost-based Optimizer and Distributed Execution Engine. You will define and execute against a product roadmap, including interfacing with product marketing for go-to-market activities. You will interface with developers daily and advocate on their behalf to help CockroachDB provide an excellent developer experience.</p>
<h3><strong>You Will</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Manage a team of product managers in the SQL product area, including the SQL Sessions, SQL Schema, and SQL Queries product development teams. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Work directly with customers to understand and address their primary pain points, diligently collect product requirements, and document customer needs.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborate with Engineering, Design, and Documentation to develop cloud-native solutions and iterate toward a delightful user experience.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Put yourself in our users’ shoes and acceptance test features before they go live to prioritize and iterate on usability gaps.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Leverage our BI platform to understand product adoption and prioritize enhancements to improve our product.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Drive adoption of our solutions by working with marketing and other departments to highlight differentiated workflows for developers.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>You Have</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">5 - 10+ years of work experience in product management, including technical expertise working with engineering and/or design teams.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">We prefer previous management experience, but it is not required </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Computer Science Degree and/or experience as a developer</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Excellent writing skills; our strategic product meetings are based on docs rather than decks. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Familiarity and comfort using SQL, including working with databases</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A collaborative nature and are an enthusiastic, amiable, and personable teammate, open to partnering with all other functions in the company.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to communicate the unique value proposition of your product area to support the Marketing and Sales teams. You will periodically produce content to drive adoption and awareness of particular features. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Expectations</strong></h3>
<p>In the first 30 days, you will go through PM onboarding with your roachmate. You will shadow your area's Senior Group Product Manager (SGPM) and understand the team culture and processes. You will meet the SQL PM team and spend time learning about their expertise, goals, and ambitions. You will spin up a CockroachDB cluster and test core features, getting a sense of the end-to-end experience for yourself. You will work with your GPM as well as our customers to understand the significant user pain points for the area and spend time getting familiar with the specific developer and industry problems your team is solving. You'll review your backlog, get up to speed on in-flight features, and learn how to understand feature adoption using our analytics platform.</p>
<p>You'll also build relationships with the tech leads, other product managers, and members of the broader organization you'll be working with daily. You and the SQL SGPM will have the first of many long-term career planning conversations to understand your goals and how Cockroach Labs can best help you achieve them. </p>
<p>In your first 60 days, you will work with the SQL SGPM to drive monthly product-market-fit meetings, which require you to summarize your team's progress towards our OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and product-market fit. You will start to vet new feature requests and add them to the backlog.</p>
<p>After three months, you will lead your team and meet with your direct reports to provide guidance, unblock development, and build their careers. You'll identify, research, and test solutions to problems. You will analyze product data from alpha releases to determine where to focus our efforts to create the most impact. There are countless opportunities for us to invest in, and you will be responsible for prioritizing the ones that will exceed our customers' expectations while generating a competitive advantage over the long term. We want our users to have a phenomenal experience using CockroachDB, which requires excellent products built by you and your team.</p>
