Our code graph powers Cody, the most powerful and accurate code AI for writing, fixing, and maintaining code, as well as our Code Search product, helping devs explore their entire codebase and make large-scale migrations and security fixes. We’re building software that builds software, and in doing so we’re making devs more productive and growing the population of coders by giving anybody access to the deep knowledge base of a senior engineer through Cody and all of the context it brings. We’re preparing for a world with a lot more code than exists today, and that benefits us all.</span></p>

&lt;p&gt;Remote is solving a huge challenge for global organizations: compliantly employing anyone, anywhere. We make it possible for businesses to employ a global team by handling global payroll, benefits, taxes, and compliance (learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://remote.com/how-it-works&quot;&gt;how it works&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re backed by A+ investors and our team is world-class, literally and figuratively - we&#39;re scattered around the world working together within a culture of kindness and excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote aims to provide customers with instant payroll calculations for their employees. Our goal is to create an experience where a customer can add a payment, click a button, and immediately view and schedule the payment.&lt;/p&gt;
