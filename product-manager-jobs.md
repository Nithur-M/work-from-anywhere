<div>
<a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Product Managers &amp; Product Designers (along with developers &amp; UX/UI folks) to team up with the best companies on their next big thing. <br><br>After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.<br><br>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>High-paying, meaningful client missions (where you'd lead Product) with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>How to apply:<br></strong>Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack">https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack</a> + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><strong><br>What you’ll do:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to be the lead Product manager/designer for impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old-school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.</li>
<li>Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </li>
<li>You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Senior Product Managers/Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.</li>
<li>Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.</li>
<li>The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>People looking for small gigs.</li>
<li>Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.</li>
<li>Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Our long-term vision:<br></strong><a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack"><span>A·Team</span></a> is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. </div><div>
<br>To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.</div>

                &lt;p&gt;Timescale is looking for an experienced and entrepreneurial&lt;strong&gt; Senior Product Manager&lt;/strong&gt; with a track record of successfully leading SaaS products end-to-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting opportunity to build the next great cloud-native database for the 25 million developers in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Managers at Timescale have a lot of responsibility and own the success of their products. You’ll deeply understand our customers, identify their jobs to be done, build product strategies to go after those markets, collaborate with design and engineering to build solutions to the identified problems, define positioning, and drive adoption, working closely with our go-to-market teams. You’ll work strategically and tactically to lead your product end-to-end, obsess about the customer experience, grow product adoption, and drive business outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll succeed at Timescale if you are entrepreneurial, bold, scrappy, decisive, and fired up in front of challenges and uncertainty and get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Timescale is a fully remote company with team members worldwide, and English language fluency is required. The preferred candidate for this role will have working hours in East Coast American or European time zones to better coordinate with their teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a deep understanding of our customers and their problems, the competitive landscape, and market trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify what problems to focus on and the sequence of steps to solve them. Provide engineering and design with all the customer, market and business context they need to define and build the right solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articulate the value new products and features deliver before we start building them and iterate on that with input from customers as we make progress towards the release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead how their products are taken to market and drive marketing and sales to effectively communicate the value of the product and drive adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define and measure success in the form of input and output metrics and connect those to the business outcomes the company wants to drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure adoption of the product, run experiments, collect customer feedback regularly, and adjust plans as needed. Use data to support your decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help support customer engagements and participate in sales enablement activities within the company as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve as the connective tissue between engineering, design, marketing, customer care, and other stakeholders, proactively communicating product questions and decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5+ years of proven track record in product management, with at least 3+ years of experience on SaaS products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent written and verbal communication and the ability to explain complex technical design in 20 seconds or 20 minutes, depending on the audience and goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to combine data-driven approaches with strong user empathy to figure out what/when/why to ship - we’re building a platform for millions of users, and there is lots to do!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excited by ambiguous and vague problem definitions and the ability to refine them into an actionable plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong sense of ownership, urgency and problem-solving skills - Timescale is moving fast, and so should you. Trying things, making mistakes, and quickly improving are in our DNA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable engaging and working in the open with developer communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer Science or technical degree preferred, or prior technical development experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By applying for this position, you are agreeing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timescale.com/legal/timescale-applicant-privacy-note&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Timescale&#39;s Applicant Privacy Notice.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Key responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify Integration Opportunities:&lt;/strong&gt; Continuously assess user needs and identify gaps in our platform&#39;s functionality that can be filled by third-party integrations. Understand user pain points, business requirements, industry trends, and competitive analysis to prioritize integrations effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop an Integration Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Define a clear integration strategy that aligns with Remote&#39;s mission and goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate with Stakeholders:&lt;/strong&gt; Collaborate and align with cross-functional teams, such as the partnerships, sales, product marketing, customer experience, design and engineering teams to ensure integrations projects are successful. Collaborate with external partners to develop and maintain integrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define Integration Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; Create detailed integration specifications, based on a deep understanding of user needs and partner API capabilities, data mapping, and user experience design. Clearly communicate these requirements to development teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an Intuitive Marketplace:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop a marketplace experience that helps users easily discover and evaluate integration options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; Continuously monitor the performance and usage of integrations. Gather user feedback and data to make data-driven improvements and optimizations.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical proficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; An understanding of APIs is essential.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify Integration Opportunities:&lt;/strong&gt; Continuously assess user needs and identify gaps in our platform&#39;s functionality that can be filled by third-party integrations.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop an Integration Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Define a clear integration strategy that aligns with Remote&#39;s mission and goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate with Stakeholders:&lt;/strong&gt; Collaborate and align with cross-functional teams, such as the partnerships, sales, product marketing, customer experience, design and engineering teams to ensure integrations projects are successful. Collaborate with external partners to develop and maintain integrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define Integration Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; Create detailed integration specifications, based on a deep understanding of user needs and partner API capabilities, data mapping, and user experience design. Clearly communicate these requirements to development teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an Intuitive Marketplace:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop a marketplace experience that helps users easily discover and evaluate integration options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; Continuously monitor the performance and usage of integrations. Gather user feedback and data to make data-driven improvements and optimizations.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you’ll plan your day (and life)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work async at Remote which means you can plan your schedule around your life (and not around meetings). Read more at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.remote.com/async&quot;&gt;remote.com/async&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be empowered to take ownership and be proactive. When in doubt you will default to action instead of waiting. Your &lt;strong&gt;life-work balance&lt;/strong&gt; is important and you will be encouraged to put yourself and your family first, and fit work around your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like something you want, apply now!&lt;/p&gt;
