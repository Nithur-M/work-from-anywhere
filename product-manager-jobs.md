<h2><strong>Who we are</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that </span><a href="https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/strategy-goals/strategy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone can code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not just ~0.1% of the population. Our code intelligence platform helps developers and </span><a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with billions of lines of code create the software you use every day. By enabling more people to code, we believe we will create economic opportunity across the world and will drive progress that benefits everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an exciting time to join Sourcegraph. Our business is growing rapidly: we’ve experienced exponential growth and our </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$125M Series D from Andreessen Horowitz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$50M Series C from Sequoia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have given us the opportunity to make big ambitious bets on our future. We have a huge market (every company that builds software) and massive opportunity (most developers haven't even heard of code intelligence yet, but once you've used it, you can't live without it--just like Google). By continuing to hire exceptional people, we have the opportunity to make Sourcegraph one of the biggest technology companies in the world. </span></p></div>

    <h2><strong>Working hours</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that we are an all-remote company and hire </span><a href="https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/people-ops/process/how-we-engage-talent-outside-the-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost anywhere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the world, we don’t have a location requirement for this role. However, your working hours must overlap wit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">h US time zones </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for at least 10 hours/week.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Why this job is exciting</strong></h2>

Our code intelligence, married with modern AI, is already providing a remarkable alpha experience, and you can help us unlock its full potential.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramp up on search, code intel, code exploration, and AI</span></li>
