You’ll lead engagements with cross-functional teams while serving as a strategic partner to our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you will do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Own client relationships as the primary product contact, leading stakeholder conversations and key decisions from kick-off through delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Define what to build by translating business goals and user needs into clear product strategies, roadmaps, and requirements — we build what’s truly needed, not just what’s requested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Drive discovery and champion for product thinking by leading workshops, conducting comparative audits, and running user research to align teams and uncover opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Deliver clarity through well-crafted product documentation, user stories, and prioritization frameworks that enable effective execution across design and engineering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Leverage AI tools to streamline delivery, surface insights, and validate assumptions, wherever they offer genuine value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;notion-enable-hover&quot; data-token-index=&quot;0&quot;&gt;About you:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;You bring 5+ years of experience in digital product management, including at least 2 years in a client-facing or agency setting. You’re comfortable operating in fast-paced, remote teams spread across time zones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;You have a solid track record of shipping mobile apps and/or responsive web platforms, and you’re confident leading strategic conversations with senior stakeholders, balancing scope, value, and feasibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;You&#39;re experienced across the full product lifecycle, from navigating ambiguous discovery phases to managing detailed QA, and well-versed in lean/agile methodologies through sprint-based delivery with cross-functional teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;You are technically fluent, you collaborate effectively with engineers, understand common constraints and architectures, and are adept in tools like Figma, FigJam, Notion, and Linear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;You’re energized by AI and emerging technologies, and excited about using them to build smarter, faster, and better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits &amp;amp; Salary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We offer competitive salaries and benefits. Compensation is determined based on a variety of factors including relevant experience, other job-related qualifications, geographic location, and business needs.&lt;/p&gt;
