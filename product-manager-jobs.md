  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> London, England, United Kingdom

</p>

<p><strong>What We Do</strong></p>
<p>Overleaf builds modern collaborative authoring tools for scientists — like Google Docs for Science. We make an online, real-time collaborative editor for papers, theses and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language.</p>
<p>We have over ten million registered users from around the world and over 400,000 people use our platform each day. Our company is scaling up and we are looking for a Product Manager (Technical) who can take the lead on one of our core product areas.</p>
<p>We were recently recognised as one of the<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-recognized-as-one-of-the-uks-top-100-fastest-growing-businesses" class="external"> UK's top 100 fastest growing businesses</a> and as the<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-named-2020-saas-awards-winner" class="external"> Best SaaS for Nonprofits or Education</a> in the 2020 SaaS Awards Program. We're part of the<a href="https://www.digital-science.com/" class="external"> Digital Science</a> family of science, health and ed-tech companies.</p>
<p><strong>The Product Team</strong></p>
<p>We are an interdisciplinary team made of product managers, UX designers and data analysts. We are a relatively new team, with most people joining in 2021, and small enough that everyone has a few hats to wear, but large enough that we have experts who can guide the rest of the team in their area, such as User Research, User Experience or Analytics. Some of us come from a teaching background, marketing, engineering, QA and more disciplines, which gives the team its unique flavour. Our mission is to explore the future of Overleaf through data, design and research.</p>
<p><strong>Your New Role</strong></p>
<p>As we expand, we are growing the product team to let us have owners for each of our core areas, namely Editor, B2C growth, Institutions and Enterprise. For this reason, we are now looking to hire an experienced Product Manager who can lead our discovery and development initiatives across one of these areas. You will take ownership of researching, understanding and delivering value to our users, enhancing their workflows for both our hosted SaaS and on-premises solutions. As part of a Product Trio (Product, UX, Engineering - plus others), you will map opportunities using product discovery methods and shape your own roadmap and KPIs. You will lead on projects related to your area of expertise from start to finish. This will usually involve: </p>
<ul> <li>Understanding user needs:<ul> <li>Carry out primary research to understand users and their pain points, identifying opportunities to address them.</li> <li>Nurture and grow our rich database of user insights, mining data as needed and present it to stakeholders in various contexts.</li> <li>Based on research insights, formulate hypotheses to be tested with a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Shaping and developing solutions:<ul> <li>Shape a vision, define the problem and align the team with clear goals, objectives and user stories.</li> <li>Map and test assumptions with a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods.</li> <li>Distil existing user research data to support the team in making the right decisions.</li> <li>Work closely with UX designers, data analysts and engineers throughout the release process, from shaping to building, testing and releasing.</li> <li>Clearly define measures of success for A/B testing, balancing the need for accuracy with shipping value to users quickly.</li> <li>Recognise and celebrate success regularly when things go well, while fostering a growth mindset when things don't go so well.</li> <li>Lead and facilitate planning sessions with your team to prioritise work, often applying decision-making frameworks (e.g. RICE).</li> <li>Keep other stakeholders informed as progress is made, through regular demos, Show &amp; Tells and presentations.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Understanding the Business. You will specifically own the relationship with a core department (e.g. Sales and Account Management teams for the Institutional/Enterprise core area, or Marketing for our B2C Growth area):<ul> <li>Develop and manage a solid product roadmap for your core area.</li> <li>Map opportunities and manage input from your stakeholders to enhance our offering on an ongoing basis.</li> <li>Clearly communicate our roadmap and product changes in advance of their launch and help them manage communications to customers.</li> <li>Take part in customer onboarding sessions, webinars and/or sales negotiations and use these opportunities to conduct user research.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Work closely with other departments to:<ul> <li>Help them access and understand product information (e.g. releases for our On-Premises product, key features, product roadmap). </li> <li>Explain technical dependencies and how they may affect our roadmap.</li> <li>Help them access product data/metrics that can provide useful insights for their departments.</li> <li>Bring the user perspective in meetings and engage stakeholders with our continuous user research efforts and insights.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Strategy and planning: <ul> <li>You will input and contribute to the main product roadmap and take part in planning meetings on an ongoing basis. </li> <li>You will develop a set of strategic goals and KPIs for your core area on an annual basis, updating stakeholders on progress throughout the year.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<p>This year, we are excited about:</p>
<ul> <li>Having launched our most popular feature yet, a way to <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/new-feature-ready-set-detach" class="external">detach the PDF view</a> in another window, which allows users to work on multiple monitors.</li> <li>Relaunching our core editor in CodeMirror 6 for improved functionality and accessibility.</li> <li>Enhancing the collaboration experience on our product to make it even more compelling for individual users and Enterprise teams. We are currently testing assumptions around shared spaces.</li> <li>Collaborating with more partners to enhance the editing experience through new technologies.</li> </ul>
<p>We also got excited when our UX team won a prestigious award for delivering a seamless integration between Overleaf and ShareLaTeX:  <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/congratulations-to-paulo-john-and-sven-best-case-study-at-acm-chi2021" class="external">https://www.overleaf.com/blog/congratulations-to-p...<br></a></p> <p><strong>How We Work</strong><br></p>
<p>Overleaf is remote-first — all staff work remotely and this is<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/about/values" class="external"> part of our values</a>. We also have an office space in London for those that want to use it, and when the pandemic settles down we'll again get the whole team together in London a few times a year for face-to-face time.</p>
<p>Our core hours for meetings are 2pm-5pm UK time; we try to schedule all team meetings during this time, including daily 10-15 minute standup calls and biweekly company update calls.</p>
<p>We always collect user feedback to inform our work. We have UX professionals on our team, and we run surveys and user interviews on a weekly basis to inform our Product Discovery process. You can read more about how we introduced these methods in this <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/how-we-introduced-product-discovery-methods-at-overleaf-in-3-steps" class="external">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>We have a flexible roadmap that we review quarterly, which includes regular user-facing releases. Our Product team works closely with everyone in the company, often as part of a Product Trio (Product, UX, Engineering, with other departments as needed) to understand every aspect of how we can best deliver value to our users. Our roadmap also includes initiatives driven by staff and quarterly hackathons to keep our learning fresh.</p>
<p><strong>How We Hire<br></strong></p>The stages in our hiring process are typically:<ol> <li>We ask you to submit a CV and a cover letter stating why you would like to work for Overleaf.</li> <li>We will aim to update you on the status of your application within two weeks from when we receive it.</li> <li>We'll follow up by email (or sometimes schedule a phone call) with any questions we have about your application, usually around logistics, your ambitions and your expectations about the role.</li> <li>We'll schedule a more in-depth interview, which is typically followed or combined with a practical assignment. For the practical, you'll have the option of either completing a homework assignment, which requires about one hour of your time before the interview, or doing an exercise during the interview, if you prefer. The exercises are practical in nature, and you can use Google, etc., and ask us questions.</li> <li>We may ask you to attend a second, shorter, interview with our Founders.</li> <li>We'll make an offer. We usually interview in batches, so there may be a short delay while we interview other candidates, but we will try to keep you informed throughout the process.</li> </ol>
<p>If you have a deadline, please let us know in your application, and we will try to be accommodating.</p>
<p><strong>Who You Are<br></strong></p>

You can switch from managing demanding stakeholders to resolving technical trade-offs with the Engineering team, always bringing the focus back on our long-term vision and delivering user value.</li> <li>Technical.

You also understand the difference between a SaaS product and its on-premises counterpart, including their underpinning technologies, e.g. Docker.</li> <li>Commercially minded. You have commercial experience within a B2C SaaS product and/or Enterprise. For example, you are able to read user research insights through a commercial lens, with a view to grow the business while shipping value to users.</li> <li>Empathetic.

<div>
<a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Product Managers &amp; Product Designers (along with developers &amp; UX/UI folks) to team up with the best companies on their next big thing. <br><br>After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.<br><br>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>High-paying, meaningful client missions (where you'd lead Product) with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>How to apply:<br></strong>Go here: <a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack">https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack</a> + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><strong><br>What you’ll do:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to be the lead Product manager/designer for impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old-school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.</li>
<li>Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </li>
<li>You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Senior Product Managers/Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.</li>
<li>Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.</li>
<li>The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>People looking for small gigs.</li>
<li>Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.</li>
<li>Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Our long-term vision:<br></strong><a href="https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack"><span>A·Team</span></a> is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. </div><div>
<br>To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.</div>
