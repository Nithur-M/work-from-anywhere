BuildBook is on a mission to eliminate that stress and bring joy back to home improvement – for everyone involved.</div><div><br></div><div>BuildBook is the best construction management platform for home remodelers and builders. Our goal is to become the default choice for the over 550,000 small businesses focused on residential construction and remodeling. It’s a $540B dollar a year industry, and we plan to make a dent in it by creating the best product in the space. </div><div><br></div><div>Builders love us because we give them simple, powerful tools to run their business and help them keep their clients happy. Homeowners love us because we give them a feeling of control and help make renovations and new home builds less stressful.</div><div><br></div><div>We are a remote-first startup with team members all across the US. We have a small, tight-knit team, a solid product that is gaining momentum daily, and big plans for the future. As an early member of the product team, your work is going to have a major impact on the future of the product and company. You’ll ship your work often and see its impact in the hands of real people every day.</div><div>
<br><strong>About the Job</strong>
</div><div><br></div><div>As a Senior Product Manager, you will lead teams and contribute directly to the success of our pro-facing product in addition to participating in strategic discussions that define the company’s roadmap and trajectory. </div><div><br></div><div>You’ll work directly with the Head of Product &amp; Design to help prioritize, plan and execute our product roadmap, and as an early member of the product team, you’ll have a lot of opportunity for growth both as an individual contributor and/or as a leader. </div><div><br></div><div>You’ll be responsible for helping to define the product roadmap, managing agile sprints and team communications, driving the QA process, and running a tight build-measure-learn development cycle.

<li>You are a helpful partner to your teammates in design, engineering, marketing, and leadership, you communicate with positivity, and focus on solutions.</li>
</ul><div><em>Discipline</em></div><ul>
