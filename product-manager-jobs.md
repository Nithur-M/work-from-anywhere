&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We’re a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Although we are headquartered in Gibraltar, this is a full time, 100% remote position&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xapo Bank is seeking an innovative expert to craft and optimize our website strategy, transforming it into a dynamic growth engine that drives traffic, engagement, and conversions while delivering an exceptional user experience. This role seamlessly blends analytical insights, backend expertise, and creative design, ensuring our website not only performs at the highest level but also aligns perfectly with the company’s ambitious objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and execute the strategy for optimizing Xapo’s website to maximize traffic, engagement, and conversions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work closely with product and engineering teams to implement and improve website analytics tracking, translating business analytics needs into technical requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply technical SEO principles to ensure optimal organic search rankings and site performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor website performance using analytics tools, making data-driven recommendations for improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create comprehensive reports on site performance, SEO performance, and key metrics to inform content and growth strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilize content management systems (CMS) to create and manage website content effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance website UI/UX to provide a sticky and engaging user experience.&lt;/li&gt;

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.</p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">At every step of our funnel, we aim to make choosing Atticus a no-brainer.

                <h2><strong>About Atticus</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">At any given time, 16 million Americans are experiencing a crisis that requires urgent help from our legal system or government. The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025..</p><h2><strong>The Job</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">At every step of our funnel, we aim to make choosing Atticus a no-brainer. Our platform covers a lot: evaluating a client’s case, giving advice, matching them with the right lawyer, formalizing the arrangement, and helping both parties work together as the case progresses. We hold ourselves to an incredibly high bar, because we know it results in life-changing aid for those in need.  A few examples of what we’re currently working on:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Improve an existing framework to match clients to the best law firm in our network available (for their case, geography, client and firm preferences, etc.) and work with the Data Science team to turn it into a reality.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Interview partner law firms to prioritize the next set of features we’ll build, then partner with Design and Engineering to craft a formal roadmap and mock up wireframes for our next product launch.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Leverage data from our call center and case details to optimize how and when we reach clients across mediums and throughout their case lifecycle.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Build a core data platform to support multiple verticals at varying scales with model-driven decision making and personalization throughout the funnel.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h2><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Get to know our users - both clients and lawyers - and understand their needs.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Craft a product vision for our next phase of growth. Go deep on strategy: become an expert in our business model, current offering, and key milestones to inform your work.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Develop a comprehensive product roadmap and build alignment for it with stakeholders and senior leadership.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Work with engineering and design to build and ship new products and features. Play the role of conductor, coordinating and empowering others.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Own key targets and metrics. Collect and analyze data, and use it to drive decision-making at a company level. Propose hypotheses, run experiments, and iterate quickly.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">5+ years of product management experience, building and shipping products at scale</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Demonstrated success in setting a product vision and strategy, and the ability to speak thoughtfully about the key decisions and tradeoffs you made</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Knowledge of best practices (from past work in a high-performing organization) and the ability to instill a great product culture as we grow</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Great communication and people skills — shown by great reviews from PMs, engineers and designers you’ve worked with</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Mastery of data platforms and ability to do your own analysis</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">A demonstrated commitment to doing good and helping people</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Bonus: Early-stage startup experience - complex consumer business, two-sided marketplace, and/or B2B product</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">15 vacation days &amp; ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">401(k) and optional HSA/FSA</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p style="min-height:1.5em">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tanner Hackett, CEO &amp;amp; Founder&lt;/strong&gt;: Having founded two other major startups, including Button and Lazada, Tanner now spends his time focused on mental health through his philanthropy,&lt;a href=&quot;http://openminded.org&quot;&gt; Openminded.org&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to reading, surfing, yoga, and enjoying the outdoors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Shafer, Chief of Staff&lt;/strong&gt;: Chris is a published scientific author, having studied the neural correlates of gratitude at the lauded Brain and Creativity Institute. He has since helped to launch numerous businesses in which he held a variety of critical roles from product management to business operations to strategic partnerships. Chris received his bachelor’s degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Southern California.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tobias Schuler, Head of Data Analytics&lt;/strong&gt;: After becoming a Fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society &amp;amp; working as a consultant actuary at EY for several years, Tobias went on to drive the actuarial data &amp;amp; systems teams at QBE. He further leveraged his deep insurance &amp;amp; technical expertise at Munich Re Digital Partners in North America, where he headed data &amp;amp; analytics &amp;amp; oversaw the data infrastructure behind some of their largest programs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT WE OFFER:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully remote workplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Time Off&lt;/strong&gt;: We offer flexible time off, allowing you to take time when you need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work from Anywhere: Counterpart is a fully distributed company, meaning there is no office. We allow employees to work from wherever they do their best work, and invite the team to meet in person a couple of times per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wellness Stipend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health, Dental, and Vision Coverage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;401(k) Retirement Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental Leave&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Office Allowance&lt;/strong&gt;: to set up your home office with the necessary equipment and accessories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book stipend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wellness stipend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional Development Reimbursement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No working birthdays&lt;/strong&gt;: Take your birthday off, giving you the opportunity to relax, enjoy your special day, and spend time with loved ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charitable Contribution Matching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COUNTERPART&#39;S VALUES:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conjoin Expectations&lt;/strong&gt; - it is the cornerstone of autonomy. Ensure you are aware of what is expected of you and clearly articulate what you expect of others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speak Boldly &amp;amp; Honestly&lt;/strong&gt; - the only failure is not learning from mistakes. Don’t cheat yourself and your colleagues of the feedback needed when&amp;nbsp; expectations aren’t being met.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Entrepreneurial&lt;/strong&gt; - control your own destiny.&amp;nbsp; Embrace action over perfection while navigating any obstacles that stand in the way of your ultimate goal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Omotenashi&lt;/strong&gt; (“selfless hospitality”) - trust will follow.&amp;nbsp; Consider every interaction with internal and external partners an opportunity to develop trust by going above and beyond what is expected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hold Nothing As Sacred&lt;/strong&gt; - create routines but modify them routinely.&amp;nbsp; Take the time to reflect on where the business is today, where it needs to&amp;nbsp; go, and what you have to change in order to get there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Wellness&lt;/strong&gt; - some things should never be sacrificed. We create an environment that stretches everyone to grow and improve, which is fulfilling, but is only one part of a meaningful life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our estimated pay range for this role is $150,000 to $175,000. Base salary is determined by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, market data, location, internal equitability, and experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to being a welcoming and inclusive workplace for everyone, and we are intentional about making sure people feel respected, supported and connected at work—regardless of who you are or where you come from. We value and celebrate our differences and we believe being open about who we are allows us to do the best work of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are an Equal Opportunity Employer. We do not discriminate against qualified applicants or employees on the basis of race, color, religion, gender identity, sex, sexual preference, sexual identity, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, military status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law, rule, or regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers.

In this role, you’ll own the product lifecycle—from identifying evolving threats and researching new detection techniques, to delivering products that help customers classify traffic, protect digital experiences, and integrate detection insights into security systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-start=&quot;1052&quot; data-end=&quot;1241&quot;&gt;You’ll work alongside a globally distributed team of engineers, data scientists, and fraud experts. We move fast, value deep curiosity, and create space for individual ownership and impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li data-start=&quot;1410&quot; data-end=&quot;1563&quot;&gt;Develop detection capabilities that identify automated traffic, classify intent, and integrate with fraud scoring systems, WAFs, and security platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start=&quot;1566&quot; data-end=&quot;1709&quot;&gt;Partner with engineering, data science, sales engineering, and product analytics to ship features that deliver real-world protection at scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start=&quot;1712&quot; data-end=&quot;1828&quot;&gt;Translate customer challenges into clear product requirements and prioritize for impact using frameworks like RICE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start=&quot;1831&quot; data-end=&quot;1936&quot;&gt;Use tools like Amplitude, Sigma, and Preset to inform decisions with product usage and performance data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start=&quot;1939&quot; data-end=&quot;2059&quot;&gt;Collaborate with customers—particularly security, fraud, and risk teams—to deeply understand their workflows and needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start=&quot;2062&quot; data-end=&quot;2170&quot;&gt;Ensure detection capabilities are privacy-conscious and compliant with global standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start=&quot;2173&quot; data-end=&quot;2272&quot;&gt;Communicate how detection features work and where they drive value—both internally and externally&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li data-start=&quot;2310&quot; data-end=&quot;2430&quot;&gt;3–8+ years of experience in technical product management, ideally in bot detection, fraud prevention, or cybersecurity&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
