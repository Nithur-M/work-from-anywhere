                <p style="min-height: 1.5em;">The real economy employs 3 billion people in shift-based jobs, yet there is no ‘Microsoft for the Deskless’. Businesses choose between paper or 20-year-old workforce management solutions, both of which harm their employees and their business. </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Sona is building the Operating System for the Deskless; an end-to-end platform to manage the entirety of a shift-based workforce. Sona combines a horizontal core engine that powers customers across sectors and geographies, coupled with vertical-specific plugs that handle the complexity of each sector that large businesses need to operate efficiently. </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">The market is enormous and the timing is perfect; with Sona we have the opportunity to build a very large, impactful and sector-defining business. In year 1 we raised over $10 million from Google’s AI fund - Gradient Ventures, SpeedInvest, Notion Capital and angels like Tom Blomfield.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">It’s a hugely exciting time to be joining the team, as we’re still small enough that you’ll have a significant impact on the company, growth trajectory and culture, but large enough that we have a great structure, experienced leaders and world-class benefits in place (such as being fully remote and flexible, and only working 4.5 days a week)</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">We’re taking the modern product experience that we’ve all come to expect in our consumer lives and putting it in the hands of front line teams. As our second Product Manager, you’ll define our ambitious Product roadmap, driven by huge customer demand, and work closely with a growing, cross-functional product team to execute it. </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Our product serves several sectors and we’ll break into even more in future. This means you’ll be turning a newly-established product into a true market leader and guiding us through the early product-market fit stages in fresh sectors as we continue to grow. </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">To excel in this role, you’ll need to be comfortable balancing multiple work streams and able to factor commercial context into product decisions, while still being a champion for our users and committed to building a best-in-class product.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Responsibilities </strong></p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Day to day, you will be: </p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Defining and prioritising our roadmap and ensuring it’s transparent and visible throughout Sona</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Working with our engineers, designers, and wider product team to deliver new features for our product.</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Building a deep understanding of our users' needs through direct interaction and close collaboration with our customer and commercial team</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Contributing to the continuous improvement of our product development process and practices </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">We don’t have hard and fast requirements, but hopefully lot’s of the following apply to you: </p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">You’re an experienced Product Manager, capable of owning a product area and coordinating your team to ship high-quality features quickly. </p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">You communicate clearly and transparently, erring on the side of over-communicating with your team and the wider business. </p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">You’re flexible and comfortable dealing with the rapid course correction needed to navigate the early stages of finding product market fit and becoming a category leader. </p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">You have the needs of users top-of-mind when building products, but you’re also able to understand and factor-in commercial context.</p>
</li>

<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Working at Sona</strong></p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">We are strong believers in giving everyone the opportunity to do their best work, when and how they prefer. That means you’ll have a lot of flexibility and control over how to shape your job and work life while getting all the support you need to succeed. We are fully remote, with overlapping ‘office hours’ during the mornings (GMT).</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">We take our health and mental health seriously, believing that we can only perform to our best when we are healthy and happy. That’s why we work 4.5 day weeks, with a flexible half day that you can use as you choose. We also provide full mental health support in the form of on-demand therapy and coaching, along with a professional development budget to keep growing your career.</p>
