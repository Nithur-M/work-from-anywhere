                <div><b style="font-size:18px;">About Acala</b></div><div><br></div><div>Acala's mission is to build and nurture the autonomous financial infrastructure of the decentralized web. Delivering on this mission will bring more financial accessibility, opportunity, and prosperity to everyone on the planet through a new, open financial system.</div><div><br></div><div>Our core project is the Acala Network itself, which we expect to become the de facto DeFi parachain and stablecoin of the Polkadot ecosystem. Polkadot provides the underlying trust primitives to our parachain, upon which weâve built our suite of financial primitives including; decentralized, multi-collateral stablecoin; trustless staking derivatives, and Decentralized Exchange. These primitives will be used by us and other teams to power open DeFi innovations, and remove the need for the intermediaries that inhabit almost every conventional trust-based financial system.</div><div><br></div><div>We have secured our support from eminent backers like Polychain, Coinbase Venture, Pantera and many more. Acala began its launch process on December 18, 2021, and we've got regular product launches and tokenomic incentive programs planned throughout 2022, so thereâs no better time to join the DeFi mission and be a part of the future that weâre building...because we're building it for you, too.</div><div><br></div><div>

<b>As a Product Manager at Acala </b>your goal will be to keep our team focused on building what our growing network of DeFi customers wants.

<h3><strong>Company Values</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Thinking in possibilities</strong><span style="font-weight:400;">: We realize that most see the world in terms of what is not possible. We believe the future is made by those who see what </span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">is</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;"> possible. Seeing a path of possibilities requires intellectual curiosity, dedication, and diligence. We are big thinkers and believers but also pragmatists, focused on relentless execution.</span></p>
<p><strong>Integrity of word, thought, and action</strong><span style="font-weight:400;">: Integrity is what is behind our words, thoughts, and </span><span style="font-weight:400;">actions. We help ourselves and others to stay true to why we do things so we can align, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">together, for the highest purpose.</span></p>
<p><strong>Diversity of perspectives:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> A good discussion is one that ends with all participants feeling </span><span style="font-weight:400;">that the other participants understood them, even if they had different ideas. This requires trust, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">vulnerability, and compassion. We believe organizations where people can truly co-create will </span><span style="font-weight:400;">thrive.</span></p>
<p><strong>Winning with purpose: </strong><span style="font-weight:400;">We are mission focused and realize that winning is a requirement to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">achieve lasting change that benefits everyone. Even though we love to compete, we understand that winning is not the same as success, but is needed to succeed.</span></p>
<p><strong>Ownership is key:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> When we own our successes, failures, best qualities, and flaws, we can truly work in a team, as a team. Ownership unlocks greatness as a team because it </span><span style="font-weight:400;">enables us to support and be supported.</span></p>
<p><strong>The excellence of being:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> Excellence is an expression of beingâof what we want for ourselves </span><span style="font-weight:400;">and others. It is passion turned into action. We share a desire to learn and excel while being </span><span style="font-weight:400;">comfortable with failing. Excellence comes when weâre courageously open about what we </span><span style="font-weight:400;">desire for this world.</span></p>
<p><strong>Unity in consciousness:</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"> We understand that we are all one. We are all working towards moving humanity forward in unique ways. We firmly believe that there is infinitely more that unites us than divides us, and our work is to bring that out in the world.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Benefits:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Competitive salary with generous token plan</span></li>

<p><strong>What We Do</strong></p>
<p>Overleaf builds modern collaborative authoring tools for scientists — like Google Docs for Science. We make an online, real-time collaborative editor for papers, theses and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language.</p>
<p>We have over ten million registered users from around the world and over 400,000 people use our platform each day. Our company is scaling up and we are looking for a Product Manager (Technical) who can take the lead on one of our core product areas.</p>
<p>We were recently recognised as one of the<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-recognized-as-one-of-the-uks-top-100-fastest-growing-businesses" class="external"> UK's top 100 fastest growing businesses</a> and as the<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-named-2020-saas-awards-winner" class="external"> Best SaaS for Nonprofits or Education</a> in the 2020 SaaS Awards Program. We're part of the<a href="https://www.digital-science.com/" class="external"> Digital Science</a> family of science, health and ed-tech companies.</p>
<p><strong>The Product Team</strong></p>
<p>We are an interdisciplinary team made of product managers, UX designers and data analysts. We are a relatively new team, with most people joining in 2021, and small enough that everyone has a few hats to wear, but large enough that we have experts who can guide the rest of the team in their area, such as User Research, User Experience or Analytics. Some of us come from a teaching background, marketing, engineering, QA and more disciplines, which gives the team its unique flavour. Our mission is to explore the future of Overleaf through data, design and research.</p>
<p><strong>Your New Role</strong></p>
<p>As we expand, we are growing the product team to let us have owners for each of our core areas, namely Editor, B2C growth, Institutions and Enterprise. For this reason, we are now looking to hire an experienced Product Manager who can lead our discovery and development initiatives across one of these areas. You will take ownership of researching, understanding and delivering value to our users, enhancing their workflows for both our hosted SaaS and on-premises solutions. As part of a Product Trio (Product, UX, Engineering - plus others), you will map opportunities using product discovery methods and shape your own roadmap and KPIs. You will lead on projects related to your area of expertise from start to finish. This will usually involve: </p>
<ul> <li>Understanding user needs:<ul> <li>Carry out primary research to understand users and their pain points, identifying opportunities to address them.</li> <li>Nurture and grow our rich database of user insights, mining data as needed and present it to stakeholders in various contexts.</li> <li>Based on research insights, formulate hypotheses to be tested with a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Shaping and developing solutions:<ul> <li>Shape a vision, define the problem and align the team with clear goals, objectives and user stories.</li> <li>Map and test assumptions with a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods.</li> <li>Distil existing user research data to support the team in making the right decisions.</li> <li>Work closely with UX designers, data analysts and engineers throughout the release process, from shaping to building, testing and releasing.</li> <li>Clearly define measures of success for A/B testing, balancing the need for accuracy with shipping value to users quickly.</li> <li>Recognise and celebrate success regularly when things go well, while fostering a growth mindset when things don't go so well.</li> <li>Lead and facilitate planning sessions with your team to prioritise work, often applying decision-making frameworks (e.g. RICE).</li> <li>Keep other stakeholders informed as progress is made, through regular demos, Show &amp; Tells and presentations.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Understanding the Business. You will specifically own the relationship with a core department (e.g. Sales and Account Management teams for the Institutional/Enterprise core area, or Marketing for our B2C Growth area):<ul> <li>Develop and manage a solid product roadmap for your core area.</li> <li>Map opportunities and manage input from your stakeholders to enhance our offering on an ongoing basis.</li> <li>Clearly communicate our roadmap and product changes in advance of their launch and help them manage communications to customers.</li> <li>Take part in customer onboarding sessions, webinars and/or sales negotiations and use these opportunities to conduct user research.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Work closely with other departments to:<ul> <li>Help them access and understand product information (e.g. releases for our On-Premises product, key features, product roadmap). </li> <li>Explain technical dependencies and how they may affect our roadmap.</li> <li>Help them access product data/metrics that can provide useful insights for their departments.</li> <li>Bring the user perspective in meetings and engage stakeholders with our continuous user research efforts and insights.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Strategy and planning: <ul> <li>You will input and contribute to the main product roadmap and take part in planning meetings on an ongoing basis. </li> <li>You will develop a set of strategic goals and KPIs for your core area on an annual basis, updating stakeholders on progress throughout the year.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<p>This year, we are excited about:</p>
<ul> <li>Having launched our most popular feature yet, a way to <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/new-feature-ready-set-detach" class="external">detach the PDF view</a> in another window, which allows users to work on multiple monitors.</li> <li>Relaunching our core editor in CodeMirror 6 for improved functionality and accessibility.</li> <li>Enhancing the collaboration experience on our product to make it even more compelling for individual users and Enterprise teams. We are currently testing assumptions around shared spaces.</li> <li>Collaborating with more partners to enhance the editing experience through new technologies.</li> </ul>
<p>We also got excited when our UX team won a prestigious award for delivering a seamless integration between Overleaf and ShareLaTeX:  <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/congratulations-to-paulo-john-and-sven-best-case-study-at-acm-chi2021" class="external">https://www.overleaf.com/blog/congratulations-to-p...<br></a></p> <p><strong>How We Work</strong><br></p>
<p>Overleaf is remote-first — all staff work remotely and this is<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/about/values" class="external"> part of our values</a>. We also have an office space in London for those that want to use it, and when the pandemic settles down we'll again get the whole team together in London a few times a year for face-to-face time.</p>
<p>Our core hours for meetings are 2pm-5pm UK time; we try to schedule all team meetings during this time, including daily 10-15 minute standup calls and biweekly company update calls.</p>
<p>We always collect user feedback to inform our work. We have UX professionals on our team, and we run surveys and user interviews on a weekly basis to inform our Product Discovery process. You can read more about how we introduced these methods in this <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/how-we-introduced-product-discovery-methods-at-overleaf-in-3-steps" class="external">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>We have a flexible roadmap that we review quarterly, which includes regular user-facing releases. Our Product team works closely with everyone in the company, often as part of a Product Trio (Product, UX, Engineering, with other departments as needed) to understand every aspect of how we can best deliver value to our users. Our roadmap also includes initiatives driven by staff and quarterly hackathons to keep our learning fresh.</p>
<p><strong>How We Hire<br></strong></p>The stages in our hiring process are typically:<ol> <li>We ask you to submit a CV and a cover letter stating why you would like to work for Overleaf.</li> <li>We will aim to update you on the status of your application within two weeks from when we receive it.</li> <li>We'll follow up by email (or sometimes schedule a phone call) with any questions we have about your application, usually around logistics, your ambitions and your expectations about the role.</li> <li>We'll schedule a more in-depth interview, which is typically followed or combined with a practical assignment. For the practical, you'll have the option of either completing a homework assignment, which requires about one hour of your time before the interview, or doing an exercise during the interview, if you prefer. The exercises are practical in nature, and you can use Google, etc., and ask us questions.</li> <li>We may ask you to attend a second, shorter, interview with our Founders.</li> <li>We'll make an offer. We usually interview in batches, so there may be a short delay while we interview other candidates, but we will try to keep you informed throughout the process.</li> </ol>
<p>If you have a deadline, please let us know in your application, and we will try to be accommodating.</p>

<strong>🌟 The Opportunity<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<br>Together with the Senior Product leadership (CPO, VP Product, etc.), this enthusiastic global Product team is defining our product vision and roadmap. <br><br>
</div><div>commercetools for Growth is a newly created solution (and team) that will enable Scaling Brands &amp; Merchants to quickly launch on a flexible, best-in-class composable stack with low effort and without the need for a big development team, keeping their iteration speed high to optimize business outcomes. The key to achieving this is to build a bundle of market-leading MACH products (commercetools products and partner products) that are perfectly connected and pre-configured. This will enable Scaling Brand and Merchants to launch quickly, iterate fast through business-user tooling and make sure that this is the last re-platforming they will ever have to do. <br><br>
</div><div>This is a great opportunity to marshal a product that has the potential to have a long-lasting impact on the commerce landscape for aspiring brands and retailers. If you are looking for a place where your contribution makes a difference, and if you never want to stop learning and growing, join our product management team!<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><strong><br>🚀 Your Mission<br></strong><br>

<li>Make sure (together with engineering), that the technical architecture of the commercetools for Growth bundle is best-in-class</li>
<li>Own the connectors between the MACH products in the bundle from a product perspective</li>
<li>Lead initiatives to enhance the experience of customer interaction with such a bundled solution (e.g. SSO, business user interface, etc.)</li>
<li>In the end, build the core of the commercetools for Growth solution, so the “Fast-Launch-Store team” (second team in commercetools for Growth) can take the bundle and pre-configure it and enhance it to enable the customers to launch faster and faster</li>
<li>Think big, scope small, and quickly iterate collectively with your team to make sure that you solve the right problems</li>
<li>Use your product sense, collectively with a qualitative and data-informed approach to creating a solution brands and retailers love</li>
<li>Become part of our product community. We like to grow and learn together, including regular knowledge exchange sessions plus coaching from peers and the Head of Product.<br><br>
</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>
<strong>👉 What is it like working in our team?<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<strong>”</strong><em>We focus on solving customers' problems. To do that, we have to constantly learn new things. We have to rely on each other, trust each other, and know each other's strengths. The way we work together as a team makes this seem easy and gives a true sense of collaboration</em><strong>.” — Catherine, Product Manager<br><br></strong><br>
</div><div>
