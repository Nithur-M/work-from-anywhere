&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers.

This is a high-impact leadership role for someone who thrives at the intersection of product strategy, technical depth, and cross-functional alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Technical Product Manager, you’ll be responsible for setting direction, driving execution, and ensuring our products are scalable, reliable, and aligned with business objectives, with a specific focus on our Platform services, JavaScript Agent, and APIs, which play a key role in supporting and delivering our flagship products: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fingerprint.com/products/identification/&quot;&gt;identification&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fingerprint.com/products/smart-signals/&quot;&gt;smart signals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for someone who loves focusing on the developer persona, who can zoom out to align strategy with long-term vision, and can zoom in to unblock complex technical initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Be Doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define and drive the product strategy for technical areas including our Platform, management and server APIs, and JavaScript Agent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partner with Engineering Management and Product Marketing team to ship and launch scalable, secure, and performant systems.&lt;/li&gt;

All Fingerprint recruiting email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
