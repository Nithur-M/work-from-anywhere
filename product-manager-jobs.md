&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We’re a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country. This is the dream that drove Wences Casares, our Founder and Chairman, to quietly transform the world of banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Although we are headquartered in Gibraltar, this is a full time, 100% remote position&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Position overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are seeking an exceptional Product Manager to lead the discovery and execution of initiatives within the product space that covers KYC, onboarding, due diligence and fraud prevention. As a Product Manager at Xapo Bank, you will act as the CEO of your area, driving outcomes that balance user experience, Xapo’s business goals, as well as regulatory compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide new applicants with a best-in-class, seamless onboarding journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect our existing members’ wealth and our business by delivering best-in-class transaction monitoring and ongoing due diligence capabilities. We truly want to know our customers and think along with them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for a proactive, entrepreneurial thinker with a go-getting attitude. You will navigate challenges autonomously and drive impactful solutions. This demands a hands-on approach, sharp analytical skills while having a strategic vision on your area.You’ll have to independently tackle challenges while excelling in a collaborative environment within Xapo’s regulated financial domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Discovery &amp;amp; Strategy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with users, stakeholders (including C-level), compliance, and anti-financial crime experts to identify challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use qualitative (e.g., user interviews) and quantitative (e.g., funnel metrics) insights to pinpoint improvement opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a vision and strategy, and prioritize initiatives within your product domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Execution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead a team consisting of (backend/mobile) engineers and a designer to plan, execute, and iterate on impactful product changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate regulatory requirements into best-in-class, user-friendly experiences that align with compliance standards and best practices in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use data-driven insights to refine features and measure success through metrics like onboarding completion rates and false positives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought Leadership&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act as the go-to expert in your product area, ensuring clear alignment of goals and priorities among all stakeholders. We want you to be a thought leader, both internally as well as externally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As such, you are always informed and up-to-date on anti-financial crime regulations, best practices and the trends in due diligence and beyond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skills needed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ years of experience in technology-driven fintech, regtech, or digital banking companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven track record of delivering user-focused products in complex domains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain Knowledge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise in fintech/regtech products like KYC, AML, fraud prevention, and transaction monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with regulatory frameworks and anti-financial crime best practices is a strong plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Skills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An entrepreneurial mindset, proactive, and you are outcome-driven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track record of successfully shipping products in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A dedicated workspace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reliable internet connection with the fastest speed possible in your area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devices and other essential equipment that meet minimal technical specifications.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;IMPACT GLOBALLY, WORK REMOTELY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Xapo, we prioritize consumer protection and adhere to regulatory requirements by ensuring that all Xapiens are accountable for upholding principles of fair treatment, transparency, and ethical conduct in their interactions with customers and stakeholders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We’re a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country. This is the dream that drove Wences Casares, our Founder and Chairman, to quietly transform the world of banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Although we are headquartered in Gibraltar, this is a full time, 100% remote position&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Position overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are seeking an exceptional Product Manager for Engagement, and Subscriptions to lead the discovery and execution of initiatives that drive engagement and boost product adoption while providing a premium customer experience. As a Product Manager at our company, you will act as the CEO of your area, driving outcomes that balance member experience, business goals, and member retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide our members with a best-in-class, seamless experience across all touchpoints of their journey with our product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and execute comprehensive engagement strategies that maximize activation, retention, and subscription rates while fostering a deep connection between our members and our product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for a proactive, data-driven thinker with a passion for member-centricity and a go-getting attitude. You will navigate challenges autonomously and drive impactful solutions in a dynamic environment. This demands a hands-on approach, sharp analytical skills, and a strategic vision for your area. You’ll have to independently tackle challenges while excelling in a collaborative environment across multiple domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Discovery &amp;amp; Strategy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a vision and strategy, and prioritize initiatives that drive activation, engagement and growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with members, stakeholders (including C-level), and cross-functional teams to identify challenges and opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use qualitative (e.g., user interviews) and quantitative (e.g., engagement metrics) insights to pinpoint improvement opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and implement robust A/B tests and experimentation frameworks to validate hypotheses and optimize activation, engagement and growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Execution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and optimize member journeys to maximize activation, engagement, and subscription rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead cross-functional teams (mobile/backend engineers, product designer) to plan, execute, and iterate on impactful product changes and engagement campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use data-driven insights to refine features and measure success through metrics like member activation rates, engagement levels, and subscription growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought Leadership&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act as the go-to expert in your product area, ensuring clear alignment of goals and priorities among all stakeholders. We want you to be a thought leader, both internally as well as externally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay informed and up-to-date on industry trends, best practices in user engagement, and innovative communication strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate technical concepts into user-friendly language for both internal and external communications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skills needed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ years of experience, preferably in technology-driven fintech, regtech, or digital banking companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven track record of delivering user-focused products in complex domains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical skills with experience using data analytics tools, particularly Amplitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with agile methodologies and product development processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in designing, implementing, and analyzing A/B tests or other experimental methodologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain Knowledge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise in user engagement strategies, customer retention, and subscription-based business models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep understanding of various communication channels and tools, including email marketing, push notifications, and in-app messaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with user behavior analytics, cohort analysis, and engagement metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong grasp of product lifecycle management and user journey optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of A/B testing methodologies and experimentation frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of data privacy regulations and best practices in user communications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with CRM systems and marketing automation platforms is a strong plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Skills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An entrepreneurial mindset, proactive, and you are outcome-driven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track record of successfully shipping products in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know how to drive clarity and communicate horizontally and vertically to stakeholders that have vastly different backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You make data-informed decisions and challenge the status quo using first principles thinking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

                <h3> </h3><h3><strong>About Atticus</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">At any given time, 16 million Americans are experiencing a crisis that requires urgent help from our legal system or government. The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We've helped more than 20,000 people in need (see our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com">12,000+ five-star reviews</a>) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We just closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 52 to 91 last year and we expect to grow again in 2024.</p><h3><strong>The Job</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">To provide a great experience for a client, we have to do a lot quickly: Understand their situation, identify their needs, give advice, match them with the right lawyer, connect them to that lawyer, convince both parties to work together, and formalize the arrangement — all while doing our best to make a complex and scary system feel simple, accessible, and human. We’ve managed to do all of this in a way that users love, but we’ve done it by leaving some parts of the process quite manual... which means we can only scale so far.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Your job is to change that: to lead the effort to transform our product into a platform that can serve millions of people. We’ve structured this role to provide meaningful ownership of our lawyer-facing and internal products, as well as exposure to all of our client-facing products. You'll craft a strategic plan and roadmap, then coordinate our teams — design, engineering, and client service — to implement it. You’ll own key metrics and outcomes, and get to think holistically about how to achieve them. The role mixes strategy, data analysis, product design, and a lot of people management. It's a hard job, with huge potential for impact, promotion, and building a team.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">You will be tasked with owning, maintaining, and expanding our core products. We are looking for someone with a unique combination of strategic prowess and operational acumen to drive this. An ideal candidate is a self-motivated, independent problem solver who is excited to ask questions, dive into the details, make recommendations, and drive results. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">You will work with our<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-behr-a9a5948/"> COO</a> &amp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-abrahams-443a4366/"> Director of Product</a>, but work across many teams (including the lawyer network, engineering, business operations) to adapt and develop solutions to stakeholder problems. It’s a pathway to several options, including staying here and growing as a product leader.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em"></p><h3><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Get to know our users - both clients and lawyers - and understand their needs.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Craft a product vision for our next phase of growth. Go deep on strategy: become an expert in our business model, current offering, and key milestones to inform your work. </p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Develop a comprehensive product roadmap and build alignment for it from the full team. </p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Implement a product development process and manage it; teach best practices to others. </p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Work with engineering and design to build and ship new products and features. Play the role of conductor, coordinating and empowering others. </p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Own key targets and metrics. Collect and analyze data, and use it to drive decision-making at a company level. Propose hypotheses, run experiments to these them, and iterate quickly. </p></li></ul><h3><strong>Qualifications</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">Required:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">3+ years of product management experience, building and shipping products at scale</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Demonstrated success setting product vision and strategy, and the ability to speak thoughtfully about key decisions and tradeoffs you made</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Knowledge of best practices (from past work in a high-performing organization) and the ability to instill a great product culture as we grow</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Great communication and people skills — shown by great reviews from engineers and designers you’ve worked with</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Mastery of analytics platforms and ability to do you own data gathering and analysis</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">A track record of running lean experiments and using data to drive decisions</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Ability to empathize with a diverse user base, including disabled and older users</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">A demonstrated commitment to doing good and helping people</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">Bonus / Nice-to-Have:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience with complex consumer services and/or two-sided marketplaces</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Experience scaling a product organization from its early days</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Past work at a fast-growing startup.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d particularly love to meet you.</p><h3><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">15 vacation days &amp; 16 paid holidays each year</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$1,000/year reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work </p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">401(k) and optional HSA</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Free snacks, drinks, weekly lunches, and regular team dinners/events/retreats</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Location</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with the best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are Orderly, the ultimate destination for decentralized trading platforms. We are not satisfied with the limitations of centralized exchanges or the complexities of building decentralized order books. We aim to make trading easy, fast, and secure for everyone. How? By fusing the simplicity of CeFi with the power of DeFi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of the issue lies “liquidity”. Builders often grapple with a paradox; traders need liquidity, but liquidity demands traders. Our solution is simple as is bold –&lt;span class=&quot;text-primary-100 font-semibold&quot;&gt;concentrate all liquidity into one order book. One order book that connects all the liquidity in the crypto space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our ambition doesn&#39;t stop there. We&#39;re omnichain, championing chain abstraction. We envision seamless transactions, where the underlying blockchain is merely a detail. By concentrating liquidity, we aim to redefine the crypto landscape, making bridging and wrapped assets a thing of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are Orderly, and we are here to revolutionize DeFi, democratizing access to financial opportunities and fostering a fair, equitable paradigm for all.&lt;/p&gt;
