<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">We have a number of captivating reasons.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Including the exponential growth that you will experience.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">We are working on the assumption that you’re an <em>A-Player</em> in your field. So we’re offering you something a bit different. A bit less run-of-the-mill.</p>

<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">(*Leverage means moving from a 1:1 output to a 1:<em>N</em>, where <em>N</em> is exponential)</p>
