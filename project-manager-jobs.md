&lt;div&gt;A Senior Project Manager at 10up is not just a task manager, but a strategic contributor to every project, and the driver for successful client delivery. Join a team of collaborative, cross-discipline professionals who have been pushing the boundaries of enterprise-level projects for over 12 years.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You’ll have ownership and input on a combination of innovative, challenging projects and ongoing support engagements—we believe in balanced and diverse workloads through dedicated resource management. We have a supportive Client Delivery structure, with established PM processes, while still allowing for autonomy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As a leading digital agency, 10up’s client roster spans from innovative startups and impactful non-profits, to some of the biggest names in the industry, such as ESPN, Google, The New York Times Co., and The Nobel Prize Committee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As a 10upper, you have options for flexible and alternative work schedules. Intentionally remote since day one, spanning six continents and 38+ countries, 10up fully embraces the benefits of distributed work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you will do:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act as the day-to-day Project Manager for 4 - 7 active projects; exhibiting senior-level ownership over all project scopes/plans, client meetings, written status updates, demos, risk management and iterative scope / expectation management.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistently track and analyze project progress and budget burn, and work with group and project leadership to escalate concerns and/or risks, and mitigate appropriately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure superior quality deliverables by collaboratively engaging cross-discipline leadership, and enforcing rigorous QA processes and standards to provide end to end delivery and client satisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead discovery engagements (onsite and remotely) that expertly define cross-discipline project requirements and that demonstrate an expert understanding of underlying client business goals and objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistently identify strategic opportunities to engage with the 10up Account Management Team and collaborate towards building strong, long-term client relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About you:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience delivering full scope CMS-based web projects for enterprise clients, ideally in an agency environment, and preferably with a practical understanding of the WordPress platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can describe tangible examples of deescalating project risks by working with members of your team and leadership to develop collaborative solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your roles and responsibilities have been primarily client facing. You are often the main point of contact for client requests, escalations, comprehensive updates, and senior-level consultation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a proven track record of deescalating project risks by working with members of your team and leadership to develop collaborative solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are an effective leader of cross-discipline project teams - across account strategy, experience design, engineering, QA and support - and are able to keep the team motivated and on task to deliver the best project outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have excellent verbal and written English communication skills, both internally and externally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of interest:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple paid time off programs, including PTO, parental leave, bereavement leave, and company holidays – including an all-company break from Christmas Eve to New Years Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health, dental, and life insurance programs (available for United States and UK team members)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retirement contribution programs (currently available in the U.S. and U.K.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible and alternate schedule programs - including options for 4-day work week (Monday-Thursday) configurations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1,000 accrued annually in professional development budget for you to spend on conferences, training, or to buy back time for programs like independent study&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global Company summits – opportunities to meet, socialize, and learn with fellow team members in person at remarkable destinations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An end-of-year all-hands bonus program, along with smaller opportunities for recognition throughout the year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expected annual salary range for this position is between &lt;strong&gt;£60,000 &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;£80,000 &lt;/strong&gt;annually. Compensation is determined based on a variety of factors including relevant experience, other job related qualifications/skills, geographic location, and business needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join our team!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
