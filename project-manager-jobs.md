<div class="h2">About the company</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Founded in late 2016, Ventrata is an enterprise ticketing platform designed for high-volume attraction, tour, and activity operators. Our all-in-one platform powers online, in-person, &amp; third-party sales, and provides robust functionality around resource management, hardware integrations, and 24/7 live support. Ventrata's solutions are trusted by some of the biggest names in the industry: Big Bus Tours, Sightseeing Pass, Tootbus, Historic Tours of America, Boston Duck Tours, Magnicity / M56 Group, Pilsner Urquell Experience, Fat Tire Tours, Museum of Illusions, multiple Gray Line and City Sightseeing operators.</p>
<p>Despite the challenging environment, Ventrata continues to grow in double digits. During the global pandemic, many attractions have restructured and upgraded their technology. For Ventrata, this has driven a growth rate of 6x — from $80m in ticket sales in 2019 to more than $900m in 2022.</p>
<p>Ventrata has been profitable since 2018 and holds substantial private backing. There have been two successful rounds of funding prior to coronavirus. No funding has been required to maintain operations through the period. Our team is based in Czechia, UK, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Slovakia, Croatia, Nigeria and the US.</p>
