We aim to make it as good of an experience as we can, and part of that includes keeping you informed during the process.</p> <p>Here’s what you can expect from the process:</p><ul> <li>Written application</li> <li>A phone screen with Recruiter</li> <li>A video screen with Hiring Manager</li> <li>A short, 2-hour or less homework assignment</li> <li>A “technical” interview to discuss the homework assignment and your experience</li> <li>A culture contribution interview</li> </ul><p>To get started, complete this application, including answers to the questions on the next page. We read every single application, and your responses to our application questions help put your experience into context.</p><p>ConvertKit is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity in all of its forms, and we hire the best person we can for each role, no matter your personal background. Research tells us that applicants who are female or non-binary, as well as applicants who are people of color, are less likely to apply for roles they do not feel 100% qualified for. If you think you meet more than 50% of our requirements but fewer than 100% of them, please apply. We’re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn’t apply.</p>
