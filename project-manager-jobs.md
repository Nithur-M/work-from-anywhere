                Your mission
Your mission will be to drive projects related to improving the Ethereum Foundationâs culture, collaboration and organizational processes. The EF is a lean organization with little formal process and very distributed authority. Individuals and teams are entrusted with significant decision-making power to act on their own discretion. This allows us to move fast, stay flexible, and to put decisions in the hands of the people best positioned to make the right call. You will make it easier for EF teams to execute on their goals by addressing common challenges teams face, by building or sourcing organizational resources and by improving access to information, context & collaboration between EF teams. You will be part of the EFâs âTeam Supportâ.

About Team Support
Team Support helps EF teams to do their best work while maintaining the EFâs lean and distributed organizational strategy. The EF wants teams to be as efficient and as productive as can be, retain their talent, and keep and expand their independence and self-sufficiency. We work to provide solutions to common challenges EF teams face, like breaking down info silos, creating a place to provide feedback to the EF, and building out hiring resources EF teams can rely on. We aim to improve access to information and enhance context & collaboration between teams and within the organization as a whole.
