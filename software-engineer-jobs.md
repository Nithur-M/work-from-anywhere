                <details><summary>Description</summary>
                <div><b style="font-size:24px;">Who Are We?</b></div><div><br></div><div>Obol Labs is a remote-first research and software development team focused on Proof of Stake infrastructure for public blockchain networks. Specific topics of focus are Internet Bonds, Distributed Validator Technology, and Multi-Operator Validation. The core team includes 14 members spread across 8 countries.</div><div><br></div><div>The core team is building the Obol Network, a protocol to foster trust-minimized staking through multi-operator validation. This will enable low-trust access to Ethereum staking yield, which can be used as a core building block in various Web3 products.</div><div><br></div><div><b style="font-size:18px;">The Network</b></div><div><br></div><div>The network can be best visualized as a work layer that sits directly on top of the base layer consensus. This work layer is designed to provide the base layer with more resiliency and decentralization as it scales. In this chapter of Ethereum, we will move on to the next great scaling challenge, which is stake centralization. Layers like Obol are critical to the long-term viability and resiliency of public networks, especially networks like Ethereum.</div><div><br></div><div>Obol as a layer is focused on scaling main chain staking by providing permissionless access to Distributed Validators. The network utilizes a middleware implementation of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), to enable the operation of distributed validator clusters that can preserve validators' current client and remote signing configurations.</div><div><br></div><div>Similar to how roll-up technology laid the foundation for L2 scaling implementations, we believe DVT will do the same for scaling the consensus layer while preserving decentralization. Staking infrastructure is entering its protocol phase of evolution, which must include trust-minimized staking networks that can be plugged into at scale. We believe DVT will evolve into a widely used primitive and will ensure the security, resiliency, and decentralization of public networks.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size:11pt;">The Obol Network develops and maintains four core public goods that will eventually work together through circular economics:</span></div><div><br></div><div>
<b style="font-size:11pt;">The DV Launchpad</b><span style="font-size:11pt;">, a User Interface for bootstrapping and managing Distributed Validators</span>
</div><div><br></div><div>
<b style="font-size:11pt;">Charon,</b><span style="font-size:11pt;"> a middleware Golang client that enables validators to run in a fault-tolerant, distributed manner</span>
</div><div><br></div><div>
<b style="font-size:11pt;">Obol Managers</b><span style="font-size:11pt;">, a set of solidity libraries for the formation of Distributed Validators tailored to different use cases such as DeFi, Liquid Staking, and Fractionalized Deposits </span>
</div><div><br></div><div>
<b style="font-size:11pt;">Obol Testnets</b><span style="font-size:11pt;">, a set of ongoing public </span><span style="font-size:14.6667px;">incentivized</span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> testnets that enable any sized operator to test their deployment before serving for the Ethereum Main net</span>
</div><div><br></div><div><b style="font-size:18px;">Sustainable Public Goods</b></div><div><br></div><div>Obol is inspired by previous work on Ethereum public goods and experimenting with circular economics. We believe that to unlock innovation in staking use cases, a credibly neutral layer must exist for innovation to flow and evolve vertically. Without this layer, highly available uptime will continue to be a moat.</div><div><br></div><div>The Obol Network will become an open, community-governed, self-sustaining project over the coming months and years. Together we will incentivize, build, and maintain distributed validator technology that makes public networks a more secure and resilient foundation to build on top of.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size:24px;">Job Description</span></div><div><br></div><div>The Infrastructure team at Obol is looking for talented and experienced engineers to help us build and support our infrastructure. Join our growing organization and you will get a chance to be in the driving seat of innovation and change at Obol.</div><div><br></div><div>As an infrastructure Software Engineer, your primary role will be building, monitoring, and ensuring the reliability of our globally distributed infrastructure that powers Obolâs network for thousands of DVT clusters. </div><div>You will develop solutions, tools, and processes to increase developers' productivity and promote DevOps culture across the engineering teams while adhering to the industry security best practices and world-class quality measures.</div><p></p><h4>Responsibilities</h4><p></p><p></p><ul>
<li>Build an enterprise-grade software development lifecycle that grows with the Obol team</li>
<li>Automate blockchain infrastructure provisioning in cloud environments based on GCP, Kubernetes,  Terraform, and Helm.</li>

<h1>Web Software Engineer (Remote)</h1><div>
<strong><br>What You Will Do<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Here's what you will do in a nutshell:</div><ul>
<li>Create new features for Narrative's Vuejs web application. Work with Product and Design teams to create the best user experience and create modular, maintainable components.</li>
<li>Design, implement and maintain embedded applications on Narrative's Data Marketplace which enhance the ability of customers to manage and manipulate data.</li>
<li>Help select technologies and define the strategic direction for our system architecture</li>
<li>Work on Narrative's Tacklebox UI library, designing creating reusable components and modules for use in all of Narrative's web applications.</li>
<li>Review and evaluate team members' code contributions, delivering transparent, honest and direct feedback to your peers.</li>
</ul><div>While most of the work focuses on the frontend, this position is ideal for someone who would like to improve his/her backend and Functional Programming skills.<br><br>
</div><div><strong><br>Technical Stack</strong></div><div>
<br>In a nutshell, our technical stack looks like:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Frontend</strong>: Vuejs, Sass, Pug, and Functional JavaScript</li>
<li>
<strong>Backend</strong>: scala, AWS, spark, Iceberg, cats, cats-effect, http4s, and doobie</li>
<li>
<strong>Ops</strong>: EC2, Fargate, Lambda, Terraform, EMR, DynamoDB, S3, RDS, Step Functions, Jenkins, and Datadog</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>
<strong>The Ideal Candidate<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are not looking for a 100% fit on all the technology buzzwords, but we are looking for someone with strong personal and technical skills who is eager to pick up new technologies as necessary. We are obviously going to expect much more from a senior candidate than we would from a junior one.<br><br>
</div><div>The ideal candidate should:</div><ul>
<li>Have extensive experience in one or more web frameworks (Vue, React, Angular etc.) and the ES6/JavaScript/HTML/CSS ecosystem.</li>
<li>Have proven experience using Amazon Web Services to deploy and host web applications and databases.</li>
<li>Be able to debug various aspects of web application code, such as cross-browser Javascript quirks.</li>
<li>Thoroughly understand the HTTP lifecycle and how the browser interacts with web APIs.</li>
<li>Enjoy building fast, user-friendly UIs.</li>
<li>Not be afraid of contributing to the entire stack when the need arises, given that frontend doesn’t simply mean HTML/CSS. For instance, a feature might require<ul>
<li>some metrics to be computed from a Spark Report</li>
<li>creating a PostgreSQL migration script</li>
<li>tweaking S3 permissions and terraform scripts for deployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have the ability to lead the creation of architectural and design documents, collect requirements as well as feedback from the development and product teams and evalute new technologies as needed.</li>
<li>Drive success in a flat organization with minimal process, interfacing with technical and non-technical team members as necessary.</li>
<li>Communicate potential technical issues to relevant teams and adapt to changing requirements.</li>
<li>Be mindful of the compromises that need to be done to be reactive on the business side while keeping the systems manageable in the long run.</li>
<li>Live/work within +/- 3 hours of EST</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>The Team (Remote US and Canada)<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are a small, early stage, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>Our Mission<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are building a data streaming marketplace that makes it easy to buy, sell, and win.<br><br>
</div><div>We do this by creating tools that reduce the friction and increase transparency in the data buying process, creating a win-win relationship between buyers and sellers.</div><div>
