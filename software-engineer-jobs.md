                &lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Description&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Kit is an email-first operating system for creators who mean business. We help creators grow and monetize their audience with ease. For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn’t a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products - all within one platform. More importantly, there isn’t a team more committed to helping creators earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform. We have always been 100% independent and 100% remote. We are proud to have built a product that our customers love, and we look for people who have enthusiasm and belief in our mission, vision, and values to join our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kit culture is one where emotional intelligence is valued, radical candor is encouraged, and where everyone works together to uphold a set of shared team principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the creator economy is powered by genuine value creation. As our Senior Software Engineer, you&#39;ll help creators build more valuable businesses by leading the evolution of our reporting functionality, enabling them to gain powerful, actionable insights into their businesses. You&#39;ll join a collaborative team of engineers responsible for providing in-app business analytics to our creators, building a scalable full-stack framework to power actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hands-on role for someone who loves Ruby, thrives in legacy codebases, and thinks like a systems architect. You&#39;ll collaborate across product, engineering, and design to ship large, complex projects—everything from architecting scalable backend solutions to refining the frontend presentation of metrics and visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need someone with a can-do attitude who can navigate complex technical challenges and push through obstacles. You&#39;ll encounter ambiguity and difficult problems, but your determination and resourcefulness will help you overcome these hurdles to deliver exceptional results for our creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your support system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll work closely with product, engineering, and design to build features end-to-end. From planning to implementation, deployment, and monitoring, you&#39;ll have partners throughout the organization focused on delivering value to creators. To learn more about how our engineering team works, you can peruse &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.kit.com/&quot;&gt;our engineering blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First week:&lt;/strong&gt; Dive into our codebase, systems, and workflows. Take part in Get To Know You&#39;s (GTKYs) to meet our distributed team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First month:&lt;/strong&gt; Assess our current reporting functionality and architecture. Begin collaborating with teams to understand creator needs for actionable insights and identify opportunities for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First three to six months:&lt;/strong&gt; Architect and implement robust, scalable full-stack solutions for reporting and data visualization. Navigate and improve our legacy Rails codebase while bringing a systems-thinking approach to building for scale and maintainability. Lead technical projects and migrations to completion. Continuously identify and resolve performance bottlenecks across the stack. Actively mentor engineers and share your knowledge with empathy. Drive innovation in how creators understand and grow their businesses through data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will S.E.T. you up for success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep expertise in Ruby on Rails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with React for building high-performance user interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of working with Design Systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion for data visualization and turning raw data into clear, actionable insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work with large datasets, ideally using OLAP systems or tools like D3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence working across a legacy codebase and understanding how to evolve it safely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience across domains like databases, billing, or analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivering large, complex technical projects, including migrations and system refactors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing code that is accessible, maintainable, and scalable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building strong cross-functional partnerships, especially with Product and Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating clearly and concisely—tailoring messages to the audience and driving clarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivering feedback with empathy and coming up with solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re a systems thinker who considers architecture, performance, and long-term maintainability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a bias for action and take initiative to keep work moving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re invested in team processes, documentation, mentoring, and pairing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You bring humility and care to your leadership and mentoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re curious, thoughtful, and enjoy solving complex challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to Haves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with D3 or other data visualization libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What won&#39;t set you up for success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needing highly structured work with detailed specifications—we operate in a dynamic environment that requires adaptability and comfort with ambiguity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferring to work in isolation—our collaborative approach means regular interaction with cross-functional teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking for a role where you can just write code without considering broader systems and business implications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wanting to avoid legacy code—we value our codebase history and need engineers who can respectfully evolve rather than rewrite everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expecting to specialize in only frontend or backend—this full-stack role requires expertise across the entire application stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation + perks + benefits&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit has standardized salaries based on position, no matter where you live. For this role, we’re hiring at a level 4 ($181,000), out of five levels. Level is determined based on experience and our interview process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to apply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that most people hate interviewing (we relate!). We aim to make it as good of an experience as we can, and part of that includes keeping you informed during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can expect from the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 min - Recruiter screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;45 min - Hiring manager screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work Sample&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 min - Technical interview&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 min - Culture contribution chat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 min - Hiring manager wrap-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, complete this application, including answers to the questions on the next page.&lt;strong&gt; We read every single application, and your responses to our application questions help put your experience into context. &lt;/strong&gt;We’ll keep you informed through every step&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity in all of its forms, and we hire the best person we can for each role, no matter your personal background. Research tells us that applicants who are female or non-binary, as well as applicants who are people of color, are less likely to apply for roles they do not feel 100% qualified for. If you think you meet more than 50% of our requirements but fewer than 100% of them, please apply. We’re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn’t apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Kit is an email-first operating system for creators who mean business. We help creators grow and monetize their audience with ease. For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn’t a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products - all within one platform. More importantly, there isn’t a team more committed to helping creators earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform. We have always been 100% independent and 100% remote. We are proud to have built a product that our customers love, and we look for people who have enthusiasm and belief in our mission, vision, and values to join our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kit culture is one where emotional intelligence is valued, radical candor is encouraged, and where everyone works together to uphold a set of shared team principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the creator economy is powered by genuine value creation. As our Senior Software Engineer, you&#39;ll help creators build more valuable businesses by leading the evolution of our reporting functionality, enabling them to gain powerful, actionable insights into their businesses. You&#39;ll join a collaborative team of engineers responsible for providing in-app business analytics to our creators, building a scalable full-stack framework to power actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hands-on role for someone who loves Ruby, thrives in legacy codebases, and thinks like a systems architect. You&#39;ll collaborate across product, engineering, and design to ship large, complex projects—everything from architecting scalable backend solutions to refining the frontend presentation of metrics and visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need someone with a can-do attitude who can navigate complex technical challenges and push through obstacles. You&#39;ll encounter ambiguity and difficult problems, but your determination and resourcefulness will help you overcome these hurdles to deliver exceptional results for our creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your support system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll work closely with product, engineering, and design to build features end-to-end. From planning to implementation, deployment, and monitoring, you&#39;ll have partners throughout the organization focused on delivering value to creators. To learn more about how our engineering team works, you can peruse &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.kit.com/&quot;&gt;our engineering blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First week:&lt;/strong&gt; Dive into our codebase, systems, and workflows. Take part in Get To Know You&#39;s (GTKYs) to meet our distributed team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First month:&lt;/strong&gt; Assess our current reporting functionality and architecture. Begin collaborating with teams to understand creator needs for actionable insights and identify opportunities for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First three to six months:&lt;/strong&gt; Architect and implement robust, scalable full-stack solutions for reporting and data visualization. Navigate and improve our legacy Rails codebase while bringing a systems-thinking approach to building for scale and maintainability. Lead technical projects and migrations to completion. Continuously identify and resolve performance bottlenecks across the stack. Actively mentor engineers and share your knowledge with empathy. Drive innovation in how creators understand and grow their businesses through data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will S.E.T. you up for success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep expertise in Ruby on Rails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with React for building high-performance user interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of working with Design Systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion for data visualization and turning raw data into clear, actionable insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work with large datasets, ideally using OLAP systems or tools like D3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence working across a legacy codebase and understanding how to evolve it safely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience across domains like databases, billing, or analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivering large, complex technical projects, including migrations and system refactors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing code that is accessible, maintainable, and scalable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building strong cross-functional partnerships, especially with Product and Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating clearly and concisely—tailoring messages to the audience and driving clarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivering feedback with empathy and coming up with solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re a systems thinker who considers architecture, performance, and long-term maintainability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a bias for action and take initiative to keep work moving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re invested in team processes, documentation, mentoring, and pairing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You bring humility and care to your leadership and mentoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re curious, thoughtful, and enjoy solving complex challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to Haves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with D3 or other data visualization libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What won&#39;t set you up for success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needing highly structured work with detailed specifications—we operate in a dynamic environment that requires adaptability and comfort with ambiguity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferring to work in isolation—our collaborative approach means regular interaction with cross-functional teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking for a role where you can just write code without considering broader systems and business implications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wanting to avoid legacy code—we value our codebase history and need engineers who can respectfully evolve rather than rewrite everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expecting to specialize in only frontend or backend—this full-stack role requires expertise across the entire application stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation + perks + benefits&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit has standardized salaries based on position, no matter where you live. For this role, we’re hiring at a level 4 ($181,000), out of five levels. Level is determined based on experience and our interview process.&lt;/p&gt;

Drive innovation in how creators understand and grow their businesses through data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will S.E.T. you up for success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep expertise in Ruby on Rails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with React for building high-performance user interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of working with Design Systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion for data visualization and turning raw data into clear, actionable insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work with large datasets, ideally using OLAP systems or tools like D3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence working across a legacy codebase and understanding how to evolve it safely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience across domains like databases, billing, or analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivering large, complex technical projects, including migrations and system refactors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing code that is accessible, maintainable, and scalable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building strong cross-functional partnerships, especially with Product and Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating clearly and concisely—tailoring messages to the audience and driving clarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivering feedback with empathy and coming up with solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re a systems thinker who considers architecture, performance, and long-term maintainability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a bias for action and take initiative to keep work moving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re invested in team processes, documentation, mentoring, and pairing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You bring humility and care to your leadership and mentoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re curious, thoughtful, and enjoy solving complex challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to Haves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with D3 or other data visualization libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What won&#39;t set you up for success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needing highly structured work with detailed specifications—we operate in a dynamic environment that requires adaptability and comfort with ambiguity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferring to work in isolation—our collaborative approach means regular interaction with cross-functional teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking for a role where you can just write code without considering broader systems and business implications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wanting to avoid legacy code—we value our codebase history and need engineers who can respectfully evolve rather than rewrite everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expecting to specialize in only frontend or backend—this full-stack role requires expertise across the entire application stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation + perks + benefits&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit has standardized salaries based on position, no matter where you live. For this role, we’re hiring at a level 4 ($181,000), out of five levels. Level is determined based on experience and our interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perks + benefits include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to apply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that most people hate interviewing (we relate!). We aim to make it as good of an experience as we can, and part of that includes keeping you informed during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can expect from the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 min - Recruiter screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;45 min - Hiring manager screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work Sample&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 min - Technical interview&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 min - Culture contribution chat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 min - Hiring manager wrap-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, complete this application, including answers to the questions on the next page.&lt;strong&gt; We read every single application, and your responses to our application questions help put your experience into context. &lt;/strong&gt;We’ll keep you informed through every step&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity in all of its forms, and we hire the best person we can for each role, no matter your personal background. Research tells us that applicants who are female or non-binary, as well as applicants who are people of color, are less likely to apply for roles they do not feel 100% qualified for. If you think you meet more than 50% of our requirements but fewer than 100% of them, please apply. We’re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn’t apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                <p><strong>Who we are</strong></p><p>MixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Security.</p><p>Team is 42 full-time, full-remote from 20+ countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.</p><p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.</p><p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.</p><p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published.

                &lt;p&gt;We build a high-performance, high-efficiency stack for window managers and display subsystems in C++, called Mir. We&#39;re growing the team and looking for new colleagues who share our passion for precision, performance and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to enable the whole spectrum of graphics from single-purpose screens through edge devices to full desktop environments. We focus on developers who are building window compositing systems or device graphics experience, and aim to give them an amazing developer experience, security, and easy access to today&#39;s most used graphics toolkits and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work on Mir and solutions built on it like Ubuntu Frame, and we also set the pace for graphics enablement across the Ubuntu certified hardware ecosystem. Our daily drill includes design, development and testing of features in those pieces of software as well as responding to issues and user inquiries. Most of the software is written in C++, with support tooling in scripting languages. We&#39;re also considering Rust or Carbon as evolutionary steps forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent opportunity for someone who wants to have a meaningful impact on modern display technologies that will impact millions of developers. Canonical offers a fast-paced team environment and a career full of learning and development opportunities across the open source spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Create documentation to enhance the developer experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with the open source community and commercial partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate proactively with a distributed team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Required skills and experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have excellent, modern C++ programming taste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a rigorous approach to software design, development and testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a solid understanding of asynchronous programming and concurrency patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have strong written and verbal communication skills to document and present software developed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are productive collaborating remotely and are highly motivated and organized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with Linux as a development and deployment platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have proven ability to consistently deliver robust code to production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bachelor’s or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Desirable skills and experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with the Wayland protocol ecosystem and compositors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with a range of Linux Desktop Environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with OpenGL, Vulkan, and other graphics and animation frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience developing and deploying on a Ubuntu/Debian system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Canonical?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, “the world’s best free software platform”. Our services help businesses worldwide to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance security with Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder led, profitable and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hiring &lt;strong&gt;2024 and 2025 Graduate Software Engineers&lt;/strong&gt; into engineering teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware, kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are excited about the potential that open source has for humanity and the enterprise, you have outstanding results in your academic career, and you are excited to contribute to the open source stack, this is the best way to apply to Canonical. We will work with you to identify teams and projects that would be interesting and a good fit for your skills and motivations. The process is highly competitive, it will require effort and excellence to succeed if you apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our engineering teams work from home. We try to align a single team in a single time zone - EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean), and AMER (North, South and Central Americas). Even though you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams that work well in the &#39;fishbowl&#39; of open source engineering. This is full time work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant responsibility. We don&#39;t generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep &#39;sprint&#39; with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a meaningful impact to open source, and see some very interesting new cities that you might never otherwise get to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find the open source stack amazing, and you have been a consistent high-performing student in your school and university, then this will be a challenging and exciting start to your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a Globally remote role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Leadership and organization skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation and writing skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business and commercial interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance.

                &lt;p&gt;This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology on autonomous devices across all seniority levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world&#39;s most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while classic, ‘deb’ based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These roles include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu Core and snapd software development&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silicon software and optimisation engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware-centric Linux QA Engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware Certification Engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robotics engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industrial IoT software engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We&#39;re looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What your day will look like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with the latest Linux kernel and open source technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliver Ubuntu for the latest IoT and server-class hardware platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate and maintain device-oriented software stacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write high-quality, well-designed software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate proactively with other globally distributed teams&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display technical leadership internally and within our external communities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help our customers ship their apps and SDKs on Ubuntu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build device OS images with Ubuntu Core, Desktop and Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimise the Ubuntu kernel and libraries for silicon-specific capabilities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debug issues and produce high-quality code to fix them&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to technical documentation to make it the best of its kind&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss ideas and collaborate on finding good solutions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate as technical lead on complex customer engagements involving complete system architectures from cloud to edge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work usually from home, with global travel 2 to 4 weeks for company events&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication and presentation skills&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional skills that you might also bring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Debian/Ubuntu or other distro packaging&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of build systems and toolchains, including for cross-compilation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with firmware, uboot, UEFI, ACPI, DSDT, or boot loaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with power management on PCI ASPM, SATA ALPM, low power profiles&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer architecture knowledge of x86, ARM, RISC-V&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in board design, bring up, and validation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few roles based in offices. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder led, profitable and growing. We are hiring &lt;strong&gt;Python and Kubernetes Specialist Engineers focused on Data, Workflows, AI/ML and Analytics Solutions &lt;/strong&gt;to join our teams building open source solutions for public cloud and private infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer on the team, you&#39;ll collaborate on end-to-end data analytics and MLOps solutions composed of popular, open-source, machine learning tools, such as Kubeflow, MLFlow, DVC, and Feast.

                &lt;p&gt;This is a general track for security-focused engineering in every team at Canonical, across all levels of seniority. Apply here if you are already an exceptional security-focused software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most product engineering teams at Canonical include one or two spaces for dedicated security-oriented software engineers. Their role is to challenge the entire team to think more deeply about security. They contribute to the product as engineers too, but their primary focus is to improve security through state of the art practices - from table-top threat model exercises to architecture reviews, from extended security testing with fuzzers and static analysis tools to external security analyst liaison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also build a number of products that are entirely motivated by security technology and requirements, such as our AppArmor kernel investments and our hardening, compliance and certification toolkits for Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the publisher of Ubuntu we also handle long-term security response and hardening for the entire operating system and open source universe. Working with tens of thousands of upstreams means that we need to be fluent in every major programming language, and design, build and adopt sophisticated tools that enable us to work at scale and speed with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These roles encompass all aspects of product security, including feature development, vulnerability response, proactive security and open source community participation. All security roles interact closely with many of the other Canonical engineering and development teams, Canonical customers and our partners across the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location: We have open roles for security specialist software engineers in every timezone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you&#39;ll do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security roles might tackle any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define, implement and document new security features&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead security-oriented thinking in a product engineering team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze, fix, and test vulnerabilities in Canonical and open source Software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to Ubuntu and upstream projects to benefit the community&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audit and analyze source code for vulnerabilities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate new tools in our security infrastructure, pipelines and processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieve and retain various security certifications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend and enhance Linux cryptographic components - specifically with modules such as OpenSSL/Libgcrypt - with the features and functionality required for country-specific compliance such as FIPS and CC certification&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with external partners to develop CIS benchmarks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and develop hardening automation for Ubuntu&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor the security industry for new developments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, test and maintain new software capabilities&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide guidance and support to other engineering teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A thorough understanding of the common categories of security vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern engineering techniques to find and fix them&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with open source development tools and methodologies&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skill in one or more of C, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby or PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience as a security champion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience driving security within a wider SDLC process&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication and presentation skills&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Optional skills we also value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear and effective communication with the team and Ubuntu community members&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working with Linux Kernel&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Certification experience and knowledge in FIPS and/or CC&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with OVAL (Open Vulnerability Assessment Language)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of and familiarity with low-level Linux cryptography APIs&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated high learning ability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance engineering experience&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canonical’s largest software products are built by multiple teams working together under a single director of engineering. Once you have passed the first round of interviews we will discuss specific software products which would be a good fit for your interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and enterprise compute.

To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering directors set the pace and the direction to help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though this is a senior management position, managing managers, we expect Engineering Directors to be outstanding developers with the confidence to lead by example across the full range of activities in their teams. You need to understand what great code looks like in the language and genre of your product - whether that is a web service, or a system daemon, or a desktop application, or a distributed system. You’ll need to know how to drive testing and benchmarking to improve the clarity in your teams around quality and performance.

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hiring Software Engineering Managers to lead technical teams in the various aspects of the delivery and ongoing support and maintenance of all Linux kernels provided by the Ubuntu Linux distribution.&amp;nbsp; As the Linux kernel itself is now quite broad, so are the technical domains and challenges involved, ranging from integrating support for bleeding-edge hardware into the latest Ubuntu kernels, to expanding the range of execution environments available to Ubuntu, to the complexities inherent in applying the latest fixes and updates to all of the &amp;gt;100 Ubuntu Linux kernels under active support during our Stable Release Update cycles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role would suit either an experienced manager of high performing software development teams, or a very proficient technical lead who is excited to take on a management responsibility. You will need to be passionate about Linux and aspire to be an integral part in its distribution to millions of users worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Engineering Manager at Canonical, your primary responsibility is to your team: helping them grow as engineers, do important and satisfying work, and have a great time while doing it. Technical leadership experience and a background in software engineering are necessary prerequisites for this role. You will be expected to lead, challenge, and develop strong engineers, positively influence the culture, facilitate technical delivery, and work with your team on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Working from home, worldwide.&amp;nbsp; We have kernel teams and openings in every time zone and with the notable exception of Taipei, Taiwan, have no offices and therefore no pressure to work from an office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role entails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leading a distributed team of software engineers in your geographic region in distinct aspects of delivery of all Linux kernels for the Ubuntu Linux distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking ownership of particular aspects of Ubuntu Linux which can include but not be limited to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with silicon or cloud partners to implement Linux kernels optimised for their execution environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring Ubuntu Linux is able to run on a wide range of diverse hardware platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition and execution of the stringent quality control standards expected by the Ubuntu user community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitigation of the latest security threats and exploits to the Linux kernel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong process automation as it pertains to the build, test, and delivery of the Linux kernel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engagement with other teams at Canonical, the open source community and commercial partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significant programming experience in C, with Python, Golang, or other like languages is also highly regarded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substantial experience with operating system kernel internals and concepts, Linux would be highly regarded but not essential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience managing or leading a team of software engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to coordinate between multiple distinct teams of differing technical focus to achieve common goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with version control practices, ideally with git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior experience developing with software packaging formats, with direct Ubuntu/Debian/Snap experience being highly regarded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel internationally twice a year for company events up to two weeks long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice-to-have skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience with kernel patching and debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong grasp of device drivers, BSP’s, and other low level system engineering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid background in driving CI/CD and process automation initiatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior public involvement with an open source project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits which reflect our values and ideals.

&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You’ll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow agile software development practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are an experienced Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are Orderly, the ultimate destination for decentralized trading platforms. We are not satisfied with the limitations of centralized exchanges or the complexities of building decentralized order books. We aim to make trading easy, fast, and secure for everyone. How? By fusing the simplicity of CeFi with the power of DeFi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of the issue lies “liquidity”. Builders often grapple with a paradox; traders need liquidity, but liquidity demands traders. Our solution is simple as is bold –&lt;span class=&quot;text-primary-100 font-semibold&quot;&gt;concentrate all liquidity into one order book. One order book that connects all the liquidity in the crypto space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our ambition doesn&#39;t stop there. We&#39;re omnichain, championing chain abstraction. We envision seamless transactions, where the underlying blockchain is merely a detail. By concentrating liquidity, we aim to redefine the crypto landscape, making bridging and wrapped assets a thing of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are Orderly, and we are here to revolutionize DeFi, democratizing access to financial opportunities and fostering a fair, equitable paradigm for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Establish a robust, efficient and concurrent trading system to ensure 7x24 hours uninterrupted operation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are Orderly, the ultimate destination for decentralized trading platforms. We are not satisfied with the limitations of centralized exchanges or the complexities of building decentralized order books. We aim to make trading easy, fast, and secure for everyone. How? By fusing the simplicity of CeFi with the power of DeFi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of the issue lies “liquidity”. Builders often grapple with a paradox; traders need liquidity, but liquidity demands traders. Our solution is simple as is bold –&lt;span class=&quot;text-primary-100 font-semibold&quot;&gt;concentrate all liquidity into one order book. One order book that connects all the liquidity in the crypto space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our ambition doesn&#39;t stop there. We&#39;re omnichain, championing chain abstraction. We envision seamless transactions, where the underlying blockchain is merely a detail. By concentrating liquidity, we aim to redefine the crypto landscape, making bridging and wrapped assets a thing of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are Orderly, and we are here to revolutionize DeFi, democratizing access to financial opportunities and fostering a fair, equitable paradigm for all.&lt;/p&gt;
