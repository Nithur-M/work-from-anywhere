Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hiring a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Senior Software Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;to&amp;nbsp;be an integral part of the team, driving process improvement, assisting the manager in running the team, coaching and developing colleagues with less experience, as well as owning functional areas from design and implementation all the way to support and maintenance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a senior software engineer, you&#39;ll be an integral part of the team, driving process improvement, assisting the manager in running the team, coaching and developing colleagues with less experience, as well as owning functional areas from design and implementation all the way to support and maintenance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Own the design, delivery, and support of features in a highly concurrent, highly distributed system that drives cloud automation and software operations at scale.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional skills that you might also bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following skills may be helpful to you in the role, but we don&#39;t expect everyone to bring all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder led, profitable and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hiring &lt;strong&gt;2024 and 2025 Graduate Software Engineers&lt;/strong&gt; into engineering teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware, kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are excited about the potential that open source has for humanity and the enterprise, you have outstanding results in your academic career, and you are excited to contribute to the open source stack, this is the best way to apply to Canonical. We will work with you to identify teams and projects that would be interesting and a good fit for your skills and motivations. The process is highly competitive, it will require effort and excellence to succeed if you apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our engineering teams work from home. We try to align a single team in a single time zone - EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean), and AMER (North, South and Central Americas). Even though you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams that work well in the &#39;fishbowl&#39; of open source engineering. This is full time work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant responsibility. We don&#39;t generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep &#39;sprint&#39; with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a meaningful impact to open source, and see some very interesting new cities that you might never otherwise get to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find the open source stack amazing, and you have been a consistent high-performing student in your school and university, then this will be a challenging and exciting start to your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Presentation and writing skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business and commercial interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits which reflect our values and ideals.
