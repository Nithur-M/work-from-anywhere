Your perspective and track record of implementing modern, state-of-the-art site reliability engineering, CI/CD automation, and service architecture automation will be a force multiplier to our growing team of talented engineers. </div><div><br></div><div>You’ll take ownership of critical DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering projects and provide related mentorship, guidance, and domain expertise to your peers, delivering a reliable service  that will delight our customers now and as we continue to scale. You should have a deep understanding of distributed application service concepts, a propensity for figuring stuff out, and some additional depth in either back-end development, front-end development, or QA automation. You were born a problem solver and love finding efficient and durable ways to solve difficult problems.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></div><ul>
<li>Build secure solutions that honor the trust customers are placing in our service</li>

<li>Evangelize the benefits of modern SRE and DevOps practices across the organization</li>
<li>Highlight and celebrate wins, as well as blamelessly assess failures from current and future attempts at implementing best practices such as CI/CD, observability, alerting and monitoring</li>
<li>Tenaciously dive into complex infrastructure as well as application code, figure it out, and improve or update it</li>
<li>Relentlessly share information, always leaving better code, practices, and documentation so it’s easier for others to understand your reasoning and follow your tracks</li>
<li>Be curious - troubleshoot operational issues when a customer is experiencing a quirky condition or when you or your teammates notice something isn’t quite right</li>
</ul><div>
<br><br>
</div><div><strong>Helpful For Success</strong></div><ul>
<li>Significant experience as an SRE or DevOps practitioner - you have experience building, operating, and troubleshooting complex applications using cloud infrastructure</li>
<li>Ideal candidates will have specific experience with Google Cloud Platform</li>
<li>Some experience with a good cross-section of our tech stack, including Google Cloud Platform, GitHub, Node.js, MongoDB, TypeScript, React, Google Apps Script/Editor Add-ons APIs and ecosystem, and Microsoft Office Add-ins APIs and ecosystem</li>
<li>Experience maintaining and refactoring legacy applications</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Why Tiller</strong></div><ul>
<li>We’re small and growing, so you’ll have tremendous agency and outsized impact on our developing culture, the Tiller service, and the success of our customers</li>
<li>You’ll be surrounded by awesome, supportive colleagues who know how to have fun together</li>
<li>We’ve been fully remote from day one; work from anywhere</li>
<li>You’ll have an opportunity to explore a broad range of development and operations tools, technologies, and practices; you won’t be siloed or pigeon-holed</li>
<li>You’ll have ongoing and repeated opportunities to pull up a seat at a lot of tables and wear multiple ‘hats’, depending on where your interests and capabilities lie; we have growth needs well beyond software development, and you’ll be close to them all, including IT, security, ops, customer support, product management, marketing </li>
<li>We’re pioneers in Open Banking, a world-wide security and privacy initiative that gives customers more control over what financial institution information they share, and with whom</li>
<li>Our customers tend to stick around - we have one of the highest customer retention rates among consumer fintech services</li>
<li>Our team also sticks around, and we have uniquely high retention</li>
<li>You will be eligible for stock options and equity ownership</li>
<li>We provide health care coverage</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Our Values</strong></div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>How we work together: </strong>Tiller is intent on making this a great place to work for our entire team. A place where our team can do their best work, and an environment that supports their full lives, from kids to aging parents, from nieces and nephews and their larger community. </div><div><br></div><div>To do this, four values that guide our work are empowerment, trust, engagement, and optimism. </div><div><br></div><div>We <strong>empower</strong> each other to do our best work. We value good judgment over rules; proactive decisions over approvals. We take ownership in our own productivity, knowing we’re all critical in the success of Tiller. We communicate openly, follow-through, and ask questions. </div><div><br></div><div>We depend on <strong>trust</strong> rather than oversight as a team. We rely on each other to make decisions in the interest of Tiller and our customers. We demonstrate positive intent so that others may presume positive intent. </div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>Engagement</strong> is the glue that holds us together. We know that communication across the wire is harder than in person, so we take risks in sharing more of ourselves with each other online. We enjoy a good laugh together.

<h1>Web Software Engineer (Remote)</h1><div>
<strong><br>What You Will Do<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Here's what you will do in a nutshell:</div><ul>
<li>Create new features for Narrative's Vuejs web application. Work with Product and Design teams to create the best user experience and create modular, maintainable components.</li>
<li>Design, implement and maintain embedded applications on Narrative's Data Marketplace which enhance the ability of customers to manage and manipulate data.</li>
<li>Help select technologies and define the strategic direction for our system architecture</li>
<li>Work on Narrative's Tacklebox UI library, designing creating reusable components and modules for use in all of Narrative's web applications.</li>
<li>Review and evaluate team members' code contributions, delivering transparent, honest and direct feedback to your peers.</li>
</ul><div>While most of the work focuses on the frontend, this position is ideal for someone who would like to improve his/her backend and Functional Programming skills.<br><br>
</div><div><strong><br>Technical Stack</strong></div><div>
<br>In a nutshell, our technical stack looks like:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Frontend</strong>: Vuejs, Sass, Pug, and Functional JavaScript</li>
<li>
<strong>Backend</strong>: scala, AWS, spark, Iceberg, cats, cats-effect, http4s, and doobie</li>
<li>
<strong>Ops</strong>: EC2, Fargate, Lambda, Terraform, EMR, DynamoDB, S3, RDS, Step Functions, Jenkins, and Datadog</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>
<strong>The Ideal Candidate<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are not looking for a 100% fit on all the technology buzzwords, but we are looking for someone with strong personal and technical skills who is eager to pick up new technologies as necessary. We are obviously going to expect much more from a senior candidate than we would from a junior one.<br><br>
</div><div>The ideal candidate should:</div><ul>
<li>Have extensive experience in one or more web frameworks (Vue, React, Angular etc.) and the ES6/JavaScript/HTML/CSS ecosystem.</li>
<li>Have proven experience using Amazon Web Services to deploy and host web applications and databases.</li>
<li>Be able to debug various aspects of web application code, such as cross-browser Javascript quirks.</li>
<li>Thoroughly understand the HTTP lifecycle and how the browser interacts with web APIs.</li>
<li>Enjoy building fast, user-friendly UIs.</li>
<li>Not be afraid of contributing to the entire stack when the need arises, given that frontend doesn’t simply mean HTML/CSS. For instance, a feature might require<ul>
<li>some metrics to be computed from a Spark Report</li>
<li>creating a PostgreSQL migration script</li>
<li>tweaking S3 permissions and terraform scripts for deployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have the ability to lead the creation of architectural and design documents, collect requirements as well as feedback from the development and product teams and evalute new technologies as needed.</li>
<li>Drive success in a flat organization with minimal process, interfacing with technical and non-technical team members as necessary.</li>
<li>Communicate potential technical issues to relevant teams and adapt to changing requirements.</li>
<li>Be mindful of the compromises that need to be done to be reactive on the business side while keeping the systems manageable in the long run.</li>
<li>Live/work within +/- 3 hours of EST</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>The Team (Remote US and Canada)<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are a small, early stage, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>Our Mission<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are building a data streaming marketplace that makes it easy to buy, sell, and win.<br><br>
</div><div>We do this by creating tools that reduce the friction and increase transparency in the data buying process, creating a win-win relationship between buyers and sellers.</div><div>

                <div class="h2">If you haven't heard of us</div>
<p>Staking Rewards is on a mission. Agency is the strategy, passive income from Crypto is one of our tactics in this strategy. We're building tools, platforms and products to help you, ourselves and others to achieve an impactful level of control over their income and help to improve the quality of their investment decisions.</p>
<p>We serve different kinds of stakeholders, investors, analysts and crypto community members worldwide. The narrative we're always pushing is Agency. We want you to be in control. ​​This is why we're on a mission to increase transparency, reduce entry barriers and enable everyone to become financially independent. We make staking easy &amp; accessible.</p>
<p>Let's cut to the chase, Staking Rewards is a close-knit team, 20 some members all working remotely, all over the world. Working here means you pick your own timezone, you pick your own vacation days, have as many of them as you see fit, get compensated well, feel comfortable saying “No” and engage in intelligent dialogues with curious people. The only thing we ask in return is to bring your A-game. Get the job done, with a positive intent and a positive attitude. </p>
<p></p>
<div class="h2">The person we're looking to work with</div>
<p>An Engineer that values quality over quantity. Has a deep understanding of software design and how to apply design principles on different types of problems. Some call them well-rounded Engineers or 10x Engineers, we simply call them good Engineers. </p>
<p>Good Engineers can learn and adapt. They are creative and curious at all times. </p>
<p>This is what we're looking for.</p>
<p>You will work with familiar technologies, but you will also be expected to work with unfamiliar technologies, you will learn on the job, you will challenge yourself and the status quo. Most importantly, you will be proud of your work. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, we expect you have gained a good chuck of experience, about 7-10 years, with different environments in your senior career so far and optimally worked in a Golang environment last so you can bring your A-game from day one.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="h2">Engineering at Staking Rewards</div>
<p>In two words, it's comfortable chaos. Our systems are constantly changing, evolving and adapting as the business alongside the crypto market does. Engineering in our environment means constantly facing challenges and being resourceful in our solutions. </p>
<p>We work the problem. An Engineer at Staking Rewards is expected to inquire, communicate expectations and be open to unusual solutions. Our strength comes from our ability to deliver strong, high quality solutions in an ever changing business environment. </p>
<p>We keep our feedback loops short and always aim to find the best possible solution together as one Engineering team.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="h2">Where do you fit in there?</div>
