You will need to get right into our code base, understand it, and make it better. You work in a self-managing, cross-functional Scrum team where you will write, test, and deploy your code, and review your peer’s pull requests. You will have to consider the architecture of new and existing features as you work, research different ways to do something, identify the best of them, and code it all up. Think clearly and tell us when we’re wrong.</div><div><br></div><div>Want to know more about the types of features you could be working on? This short video will get you up to speed fast.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Does this sound like you?</strong></div><div><br></div><ul>

<li>Detail-oriented and precise in code, communication, and documentation</li>
<li>You have the insight to know what’s important and the dedication to get it done</li>

</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Technical skills required:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>While existing experience with the technologies we use is welcome, an open and disciplined approach to your work is more important to us than whether you already know .NET, TypeScript, or anything else in our stack. We value the willingness to learn our technologies and environment over domain-specific skills. You just have to show us that you are the kind of person who is at home learning a new programming language.</div><div><br></div><div>We use .NET MVC, .NET Core, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, C#, REACT and TypeScript. Our systems run on AWS, our code is hosted on GitHub, our builds run on TeamCity.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>The Software Engineering Team</strong></div><div><br></div><div>We are a small team of talented, multi-cultural engineers, distributed across the globe. We embrace industry best practice such as clean coding, code reviews, automated tests, continuous integration, and few-click deployments. We are 100% distributed so we rely on good communication via Slack or Zoom calls within our team and wider organisation.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How to apply</strong></div><div><br></div><div>If you are interested in this position, please click apply to submit your resume in PDF format and answer a couple of questions about how you like to work. We are looking forward to reading all about why this role and organisation caught your attention, and what motivates you in your career.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Our process</strong></div><ol>

<li>Technical assessment for you to complete at home in your own time</li>
<li>Technical review of your work with future colleagues</li>
<li>Discussion with our Engineering Manager and CTO</li>
<li>Background check</li>
