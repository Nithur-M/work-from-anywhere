<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">The data must flow</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"><strong>What we are building:</strong></p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">We are building a collaborative open-access ETL for blockchain data. Blockchain data, like many open data sources, requires extensive domain knowledge to wrangle it into useful formats before one can derive value from it. Often, this work is done in silos and limited in scope, resulting in repeated wasted efforts. We are inspired by projects in other domains that evade this trap like Wikipedia which has arguably become <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/wikipedia-the-most-reliable-source-on-the-internet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>the most reliable repository of knowledge</u></a> to have ever existed by fostering an extensive network of contributors and quality control practices/tools.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">We aim to build a platform where blockchain analysts and engineers can work together to collaborate on data transformations and create the world’s most accurate repository of blockchain data. We already have a thriving community of contributors with excellent retention from a wide range of backgrounds. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/graphs/contributors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>insights</u></a> page on our Github repo to see for yourself. </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Where you come in: You’ll help our community by building the infrastructure that allows us to:</p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Build open data pipelines in a world where most tools are built for closed teams.</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Accelerate the code review process by automating and simplifying the range of checks reviewers need to make. </p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Orchestrate robust pipelines that are resilient to user error in a fast paced contribution pipeline. </p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Understand and prioritize the needs of our diverse community from amateur data sleuths to professional data scientists and engineers.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"><strong>About the role:</strong></p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Dune is a small team building large things. We are generalist engineers who pick up any and all challenges together. We like to think and design before jumping into coding.</p>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">In this role you will:</p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Assume ownership of data transformation pipelines that take <a href="https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>community contributed SQL transformations</u></a> as an input.</p>

</li>

<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Write code mostly in Python, SQL and some Kotlin with a strong emphasis on good design and performance</p>

<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"> </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;"><strong>You might be a great fit for this role if:</strong></p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">You are a strong generalist with fundamental computer science knowledge. You use this knowledge to easily adapt to new technologies and scenarios, and to find the right solutions for the problems at hand.</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">You have an understanding of distributed system design. Our work is as much about understanding and designing systems as it is about coding in a particular language.</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">You have great collaboration and communication skills. We work on the principle that the best output emerges from effective team work and respectful/constructive discussions.</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Versatility. You will be working within your team across the following spectrum:</p>

<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">You know your way around crypto and/or smart contracts.</p>
</li>
<li style="">

</li>
<li style="">
<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">You have experience with database internals, massive data storage and processing, and systems performance</p>

<p style="min-height: 1.5em;">Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women and people of colour are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. We are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.</p>
