                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hiring a Software Engineer, Sustaining Engineering for ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This role is an opportunity for a technologist with a passion for Linux and open source to build a career with Canonical and drive success for our customers, community and the company. If you have an affinity for open source development, great communication skills, and a passion for troubleshooting and fixing issues in technology used by millions across the world, then you will enjoy working with some of the best people in the industry at Canonical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This role deals with critical issues in the open source stack that require software engineering for upstream fixes. Our engineers have to be able to work productively at any level of the stack above the kernel, in a wide range of languages, to understand and address the software issues at hand. Our group is critical to the success of our enterprise customers, partners and Ubuntu itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will help with troubleshooting and driving issues to resolution with workarounds, guidance, and fixes to be released upstream and in Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Prioritizing work and managing your time effectively against those priorities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participating in team discussions to improve processes, tools, and documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining clear, technical and concise communications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working from home and travel internationally up to 10% of work time for team meetings, events and conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional experience as a software engineer&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background in Computer Science, STEM or similar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong experience with Linux, OpenStack, Kubernetes or other cloud technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong development-level experience with Python, Go, C, C++ on Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to troubleshoot with gdb and other tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with git source code repositories and branches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An exceptional academic track record from both high school and preferably university&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willingness to travel up to 4 times a year for internal events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nice-to-have skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You are curious, flexible, articulate, and accountable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You value soft skills and are passionate, enterprising, thoughtful, and self-motivated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have interest in, and experience with most of the following: Ubuntu Linux - kernel or userspace, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Ceph, QEMU/KVM, LXC/LXD, Python, Go, C, Postgresql, Mongo, Debian packaging, distributed systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
