&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Kit is an email-first operating system for creators who mean business. We help creators grow and monetize their audience with ease. For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn’t a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products - all within one platform. More importantly, there isn’t a team more committed to helping creators earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform. We have always been 100% independent and 100% remote. We are proud to have built a product that our customers love, and we look for people who have enthusiasm and belief in our mission, vision, and values to join our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kit culture is one where emotional intelligence is valued, radical candor is encouraged, and where everyone works together to uphold a set of shared team principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;We are hiring a Senior Software Engineer who enjoys creating beautiful experiences and has empathy for the Creators we serve. You will be joining the Builders Squad, which is responsible for building the suite of tools Creators use to build their emails, landing pages, Creator Profile, and more. This squad builds and supports features that directly impact our growth, conversions, and churn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;To learn more about how our engineering team works, you can peruse&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.kit.com/&quot;&gt;our engineering blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Actively participate in driving the technical direction of our codebase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with team members across the organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proactive communication with product stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staying up to date with current technical best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A commitment to mentoring and teaching other engineers formally and informally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to dive deep into problems, especially in maintaining and improving legacy applications, ensuring long-term stability beyond quick fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to take on ambiguous tasks, propose solutions, and independently execute projects. Self-starters with strong initiative are key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A strong growth mindset, leadership, and ownership with a drive to continuously improve and take on new challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong written and verbal communication skills, with a focus on documenting technical work clearly and making it accessible to all stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be autonomous and self-motivated to work effectively in a 100% remote company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have enthusiasm for and belief in our&lt;a href=&quot;https://kit.com/mission&quot;&gt; mission, vision, and values&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that most people hate interviewing (we relate!). We aim to make it as good of an experience as we can, and part of that includes keeping you informed during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can expect from the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 min - Recruiter screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;45 min - Hiring manager screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work Sample&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 min - Technical Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 min - Culture contribution chat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 min - Hiring manager wrap-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, complete this application, including answers to the questions on the next page.&lt;strong&gt; We read every single application, and your responses to our application questions help put your experience into context. &lt;/strong&gt;We’ll keep you informed through every step&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kit is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity in all of its forms, and we hire the best person we can for each role, no matter your personal background. Research tells us that applicants who are female or non-binary, as well as applicants who are people of color, are less likely to apply for roles they do not feel 100% qualified for. If you think you meet more than 50% of our requirements but fewer than 100% of them, please apply. We’re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn’t apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population. We&#39;re building the code intelligence platform that powers the world&#39;s best code search and the most popular open-source code AI tool. It’s an exciting time to join Sourcegraph—AI has taken over the world, and we aim to automate 99% of the toil in software engineering with our code understanding and code AI tools, leaving the remaining 1% to the irreplicable creative spark from humans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our customers range from startups to the Fortune 500, 4/5 FAANG companies, government organizations, Uber, Plaid, and more. We’ve raised $225M at a $2.625B valuation from &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt; Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/craft-ventures/why-we-invested-in-sourcegraph-5ace28317e3d&quot;&gt;Craft&lt;/a&gt; and others.

However, if you feel qualified, we welcome you to apply regardless of location. No matter what, working hours must overlap with PST for at least 20 hours/week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source code is at the heart of Sourcegraph. We support multiple code hosts and retrieve, store, index, and serve source code - to end users, admins, and other internal services. Our latest addition to our product catalog, Cody, reimagines how code is written and supercharges our developer customers. Sourcegraph hosts the infrastructure for our customers to manage their source code (search, insights, own, etc.) and our brand new AI Code Assistant (Cody).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role gives you the opportunity to solve complex, challenging, and highly technical problems for our customers, both internally and externally, help unleash the potential and productivity of our Engineering teams, and delight our customers with industry-leading quality software.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Operation team primarily focuses on building a fully managed platform for using Sourcegraph, Sourcegraph Cloud, our SaaS offering. As a member of the Cloud Ops team, you will work closely with both external customers and internal stakeholders to meet their needs. You will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop inter-cloud connectivity solutions to support enterprise customers from highly regulated industries to use Sourcegraph Cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a control plane to orchestrate a fleet of single-tenant Sourcegraph Cloud instances.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expose complex infrastructure as API to support internal customers to iterate faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dive into upstream dependencies (e.g., CDK for Terraform, Terraform providers for GCP)&amp;nbsp; to debug and patch non-trivial problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an advocate for building reliable services and work with leadership to help product teams achieve operational excellence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in on-call rotation to uphold our contractual SLA commitments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within one month, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard onto the Sourcegraph architecture, tooling, and development workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a solid understanding of the team’s areas of ownership, technical challenges, and problems the team solves for our customers, and know how all of these align with the top-level company goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively participate in team meetings, sharing ideas and insights to contribute to the overall team goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start contributing to the team goals and deliverables by shipping new features, debugging issues, and fixing bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within three months, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the Cloud infrastructure, its underlying technologies, and its integration within the Sourcegraph ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead initiatives contributing to team goals through both discovery and delivery phases, collaborating directly with product and design partners, other engineering teams, and non-technical stakeholders from different departments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the architectural design and implementation of new features or improvements, actively shaping the future direction of Cloud infrastructure based on customer needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead initiatives contributing to team goals on the roadmap by going through the entire product development lifecycle discovery, design, implementation, and delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in our on-call rotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within six months, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be defining long-term technical vision and strategies for new product development, scaling existing services, and managing technical debt. These plans will consist of multiple smaller milestones, which you will deliver with the team iteratively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with the Engineering Manager on defining the team’s growth strategy based on the long-term product vision, the technical vision, and the team’s needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek feedback from customers and stakeholders to identify opportunities for further improvements or new features, actively iterating on the Cloud infrastructure to ensure it continues to meet our high bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bring a product mindset in balancing architectural flexibility and philosophy with meeting immediate customer demand. You are an experienced software engineer who looks to solve problems through writing code rather than one-off operations. You are passionate about user experience and self-service. You balance maintaining and designing high-impact systems with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g., cut scope, low-tech vs. custom complex solutions) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in Go, or other strongly typed languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge in one of the public cloud platform providers (GCP, AWS, Azure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Terraform (or similar IaC solutions) and Kubernetes to build tooling and automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skilled at debugging distributed systems followed by designing and implementing solutions to those problems. This means you should know your way around various OS-level primitives, e.g., network, CPU, and memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferred time zone between UTC-8 and UTC+2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built services and exposed them as API for external consumption&amp;nbsp; (e.g., gRPC).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable implementing system-level software&amp;nbsp; (e.g., custom transport protocol) if needed or has contributed to Kubernetes controllers/operators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published blog posts and/or tech talks about your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on small high-performing teams, preferably tech startups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bring a product mindset in balancing architectural flexibility and philosophy with meeting immediate customer demand. You are an experienced software engineer who looks to solve problems through writing code rather than one-off operations. You are passionate about user experience and self-service. You balance maintaining and designing high-impact systems with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g., cut scope, low-tech vs. custom complex solutions) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in Typescript and Go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in SQL, or other data analysis languages.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Knowledge in one of the public cloud platform providers (GCP, AWS, Azure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Terraform (or similar IaC solutions) and Kubernetes to build tooling and automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skilled at designing and debugging systems full-stack. This means you should know your way around various OS-level primitives, e.g., network, CPU, and memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built services and exposed them as API for external consumption&amp;nbsp; (e.g., gRPC).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience writing extensions for one or more of the following: Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio, or Eclipse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with compilers, language server protocols, code intelligence, or related technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working closely with Product and Design teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous role in a startup environment, comfortable with rapid iteration and adaptable to shifting priorities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable implementing system-level software&amp;nbsp; (e.g., custom transport protocol) if needed or has contributed to Kubernetes controllers/operators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on small high-performing teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                <p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
<p>MixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Security.</p>
<p>Team is 40 full-time, full-remote from 20+ countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.</p>
<p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.</p>
<p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.</p>
<p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.</p>
<p><strong>Who we’re looking for</strong></p>
<p>We're hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning/data science, data transformation/ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more. We'll cater the role to whatever subset of these areas match your interests.</p>
<p>Beneficial experience includes PostgreSQL, Python, Rust, Linux, TypeScript, Nix, frontend/backend web development, and data mining.</p>
<p>Please include your updated resume when applying for this role.</p>

                <p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
<p>MixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Security.</p>
<p>Team is 44 full-time, full-remote from 20+ countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.</p>
<p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.</p>
<p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.</p>
<p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.</p>
<p><strong>Who we’re looking for</strong></p>
<p>We're hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning/data science, data transformation/ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more. We'll cater the role to whatever subset of these areas match your interests.</p>
<p>Beneficial experience includes PostgreSQL, Python, Rust, Linux, TypeScript, Nix, frontend/backend web development, and data mining.</p>
<p>Please include your updated resume when applying for this role.</p>

      <p>This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels.</p>
<p>We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.</p>
<p>Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.</p>
<p>These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.</p>
<p>But while classic, ‘deb’ based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.</p>
<p>We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux and RTOS software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general.

</ul>
<p>At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We're looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.</p>
<p>Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.</p>
<h2>What your day will look like</h2>
<p>Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:</p>

<li>Passion for embedded systems software (e.g. kernel, graphics, Yocto, RTOS)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fluency in at least one of Golang, C, C++, or Rust&nbsp;</li>
<li>Professional written and spoken English&nbsp;</li>
<li>Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&nbsp;</li>
<li>Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation&nbsp;</li>
<li>Excellent communication and presentation skills&nbsp;</li>
<li>Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each</li>

      <p>This is a general track for security-focused engineering in every team at Canonical, across all levels of seniority. Apply here if you are already an exceptional security-focused software engineer.</p>
<p>Most product engineering teams at Canonical include one or two spaces for dedicated security-oriented software engineers. Their role is to challenge the entire team to think more deeply about security. They contribute to the product as engineers too, but their primary focus is to improve security through state of the art practices - from table-top threat model exercises to architecture reviews, from extended security testing with fuzzers and static analysis tools to external security analyst liaison.</p>
<p>We also build a number of products that are entirely motivated by security technology and requirements, such as our AppArmor kernel investments and our hardening, compliance and certification toolkits for Ubuntu.</p>
<p>As the publisher of Ubuntu we also handle long-term security response and hardening for the entire operating system and open source universe. Working with tens of thousands of upstreams means that we need to be fluent in every major programming language, and design, build and adopt sophisticated tools that enable us to work at scale and speed with confidence.</p>
<p>These roles encompass all aspects of product security, including feature development, vulnerability response, proactive security and open source community participation. All security roles interact closely with many of the other Canonical engineering and development teams, Canonical customers and our partners across the open source community.</p>
<p>Location: We have open roles for security specialist software engineers in every timezone.</p>

<li>Audit and analyze source code for vulnerabilities&nbsp;</li>
<li>Integrate new tools in our security infrastructure, pipelines and processes</li>
<li>Achieve and retain various security certifications&nbsp;</li>
<li>Extend and enhance Linux cryptographic components - specifically with modules such as OpenSSL/Libgcrypt - with the features and functionality required for country-specific compliance such as FIPS and CC certification&nbsp;</li>
<li>Work with external partners to develop CIS benchmarks</li>
<li>Design and develop hardening automation for Ubuntu&nbsp;</li>
<li>Monitor the security industry for new developments&nbsp;</li>
<li>Develop, test and maintain new software capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>A thorough understanding of the common categories of security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Modern engineering techniques to find and fix them&nbsp;</li>
<li>Familiarity with open source development tools and methodologies&nbsp;</li>
<li>Skill in one or more of C, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby or PHP</li>
<li>Experience as a security champion</li>
<li>Experience driving security within a wider SDLC process&nbsp;</li>
<li>Professional written and spoken English&nbsp;</li>
<li>Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&nbsp;</li>
<li>Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation&nbsp;</li>
<li>Excellent communication and presentation skills&nbsp;</li>
<li>Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments&nbsp;</li>
