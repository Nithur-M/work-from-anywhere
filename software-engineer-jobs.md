&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Kit is an email-first operating system for creators who mean business. We help creators grow and monetize their audience with ease. For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn’t a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products - all within one platform. More importantly, there isn’t a team more committed to helping creators earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform. We have always been 100% independent and 100% remote. We are proud to have built a product that our customers love, and we look for people who have enthusiasm and belief in our mission, vision, and values to join our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kit culture is one where emotional intelligence is valued, radical candor is encouraged, and where everyone works together to uphold a set of shared team principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;We are hiring a Senior Software Engineer who enjoys creating beautiful experiences and has empathy for the Creators we serve. You will be joining the Builders Squad, which is responsible for building the suite of tools Creators use to build their emails, landing pages, Creator Profile, and more. This squad builds and supports features that directly impact our growth, conversions, and churn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Previous experience writing code that is accessible, scalable, maintainable, and performant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A keen interest in working closely with Product and Engineering managers on prioritization. That includes analyzing risks and dependencies for proposed features, and providing insight into scope we can cut while still meeting business goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A commitment to mentoring and teaching other engineers formally and informally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to dive deep into problems, especially in maintaining and improving legacy applications, ensuring long-term stability beyond quick fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to take on ambiguous tasks, propose solutions, and independently execute projects. Self-starters with strong initiative are key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A strong growth mindset, leadership, and ownership with a drive to continuously improve and take on new challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong written and verbal communication skills, with a focus on documenting technical work clearly and making it accessible to all stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be autonomous and self-motivated to work effectively in a 100% remote company.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Attend our bi-annual company retreats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least a 4 hour overlap with teammates based in the east coast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to apply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that most people hate interviewing (we relate!). We aim to make it as good of an experience as we can, and part of that includes keeping you informed during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can expect from the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 min - Recruiter screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;45 min - Hiring manager screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work Sample&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 min - Technical Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 min - Culture contribution chat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 min - Hiring manager wrap-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, complete this application, including answers to the questions on the next page.&lt;strong&gt; We read every single application, and your responses to our application questions help put your experience into context. &lt;/strong&gt;We’ll keep you informed through every step&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity in all of its forms, and we hire the best person we can for each role, no matter your personal background. Research tells us that applicants who are female or non-binary, as well as applicants who are people of color, are less likely to apply for roles they do not feel 100% qualified for. If you think you meet more than 50% of our requirements but fewer than 100% of them, please apply. We’re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn’t apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn’t a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products - all within one platform. More importantly, there isn’t a team more committed to helping creators earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform. We have always been 100% independent and 100% remote. We are proud to have built a product that our customers love, and we look for people who have enthusiasm and belief in our mission, vision, and values to join our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kit culture is one where emotional intelligence is valued, radical candor is encouraged, and where everyone works together to uphold a set of shared team principles.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ll join a collaborative team of engineers responsible for providing in-app business analytics to our creators, building a scalable full-stack framework to power actionable insights used by multiple engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;We’re looking for an engineer who has deep expertise in working with full stack with design and visualization libraries for large datasets, enjoys solving technical challenges at scale, and has a strong desire to share their expertise and knowledge with others. You’ll be working closely with design, product, and engineering to ensure the application’s event data is stored, presented, and visualized effectively and performantly, empowering creators to make informed decisions about their business growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to apply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that most people hate interviewing (we relate!). We aim to make it as good of an experience as we can, and part of that includes keeping you informed during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can expect from the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 min - Recruiter screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;45 min - Hiring manager screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work Sample&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 min - Technical interview&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 min - Culture contribution chat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 min - Hiring manager wrap-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, complete this application, including answers to the questions on the next page.&lt;strong&gt; We read every single application, and your responses to our application questions help put your experience into context. &lt;/strong&gt;We’ll keep you informed through every step&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kit is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity in all of its forms, and we hire the best person we can for each role, no matter your personal background. Research tells us that applicants who are female or non-binary, as well as applicants who are people of color, are less likely to apply for roles they do not feel 100% qualified for. If you think you meet more than 50% of our requirements but fewer than 100% of them, please apply. We’re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn’t apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating developers &lt;/strong&gt;with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hours &amp;amp; location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🌎 While we are an all-remote company and hire &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcegraph.notion.site/How-we-engage-talent-outside-of-the-US-218f7193695a46cbb1ef39ef9c1f72d4&quot;&gt;almost anywhere&lt;/a&gt; in the world, we have a preference for someone to reside in the following locations for this role. However, if you feel qualified, we welcome you to apply regardless of location. No matter what, working hours must overlap with PST for at least 10 hours/week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preferred locations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;San Francisco (in-office)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;North America (remote)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;South America (remote)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EMEA (remote)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not subscribe to “I do my best work when I work 40 hours a week.” &amp;nbsp;People we hire at Sourcegraph believe that building outstanding things means working very hard — smarter and more hours than the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this job is exciting&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Software Engineer on Sourcegraph&#39;s Search Platform team, you will play a central role in developing innovative code search solutions. Our search tool is trusted by some of the world&#39;s largest organizations to answer complex questions about their source code that no other tool can address. The Search Platform team is responsible for the systems that index and query code, delivering high-quality results to both users and AI agents. The team works across the search stack from optimizing low level index storage to leveraging ML models to optimize the ranking and relevance of search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within three months, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Increase understanding of the product, technology, and tools to become comfortable with diagnosing issues, proposing and leading solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively contribute to the team’s technical discussions, architecture designs and help your team grow technical and non-technical skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in the team’s on-call and support rotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within six months and beyond, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By writing and reviewing RFCs and stories and collaborating with the team, you will actively shape the direction and participate in the planning of the features to be built by the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will collaborate with your engineering peers on identifying and solving different technical and organizational challenges in a rapidly growing engineering organization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;We build a high-performance, high-efficiency stack for window managers and display subsystems in C++, called Mir. We&#39;re growing the team and looking for new colleagues who share our passion for precision, performance and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to enable the whole spectrum of graphics from single-purpose screens through edge devices to full desktop environments. We focus on developers who are building window compositing systems or device graphics experience, and aim to give them an amazing developer experience, security, and easy access to today&#39;s most used graphics toolkits and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work on Mir and solutions built on it like Ubuntu Frame, and we also set the pace for graphics enablement across the Ubuntu certified hardware ecosystem. Our daily drill includes design, development and testing of features in those pieces of software as well as responding to issues and user inquiries. Most of the software is written in C++, with support tooling in scripting languages. We&#39;re also considering Rust or Carbon as evolutionary steps forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent opportunity for someone who wants to have a meaningful impact on modern display technologies that will impact millions of developers. Canonical offers a fast-paced team environment and a career full of learning and development opportunities across the open source spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Create documentation to enhance the developer experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with the open source community and commercial partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate proactively with a distributed team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Required skills and experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have excellent, modern C++ programming taste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a rigorous approach to software design, development and testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a solid understanding of asynchronous programming and concurrency patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have strong written and verbal communication skills to document and present software developed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are productive collaborating remotely and are highly motivated and organized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with Linux as a development and deployment platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have proven ability to consistently deliver robust code to production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bachelor’s or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Desirable skills and experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with the Wayland protocol ecosystem and compositors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with a range of Linux Desktop Environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with OpenGL, Vulkan, and other graphics and animation frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience developing and deploying on a Ubuntu/Debian system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Canonical?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, “the world’s best free software platform”. Our services help businesses worldwide to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance security with Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of experience, perspectives, and background create a better work environment and better products.

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder led, profitable and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hiring &lt;strong&gt;2024 and 2025 Graduate Software Engineers&lt;/strong&gt; into engineering teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware, kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are excited about the potential that open source has for humanity and the enterprise, you have outstanding results in your academic career, and you are excited to contribute to the open source stack, this is the best way to apply to Canonical. We will work with you to identify teams and projects that would be interesting and a good fit for your skills and motivations. The process is highly competitive, it will require effort and excellence to succeed if you apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our engineering teams work from home. We try to align a single team in a single time zone - EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean), and AMER (North, South and Central Americas). Even though you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams that work well in the &#39;fishbowl&#39; of open source engineering. This is full time work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant responsibility. We don&#39;t generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep &#39;sprint&#39; with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a meaningful impact to open source, and see some very interesting new cities that you might never otherwise get to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find the open source stack amazing, and you have been a consistent high-performing student in your school and university, then this will be a challenging and exciting start to your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Business and commercial interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/h3&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology on autonomous devices across all seniority levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world&#39;s most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while classic, ‘deb’ based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These roles include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu Core and snapd software development&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silicon software and optimisation engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware-centric Linux QA Engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware Certification Engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robotics engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industrial IoT software engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We&#39;re looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What your day will look like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with the latest Linux kernel and open source technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliver Ubuntu for the latest IoT and server-class hardware platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate and maintain device-oriented software stacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write high-quality, well-designed software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate proactively with other globally distributed teams&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display technical leadership internally and within our external communities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help our customers ship their apps and SDKs on Ubuntu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build device OS images with Ubuntu Core, Desktop and Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimise the Ubuntu kernel and libraries for silicon-specific capabilities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debug issues and produce high-quality code to fix them&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to technical documentation to make it the best of its kind&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss ideas and collaborate on finding good solutions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate as technical lead on complex customer engagements involving complete system architectures from cloud to edge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work usually from home, with global travel 2 to 4 weeks for company events&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion for Linux or embedded systems software (e.g. kernel, graphics, Yocto)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluency in at least one of Golang, C, C++, or Rust&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication and presentation skills&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional skills that you might also bring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Debian/Ubuntu or other distro packaging&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of build systems and toolchains, including for cross-compilation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with firmware, uboot, UEFI, ACPI, DSDT, or boot loaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with power management on PCI ASPM, SATA ALPM, low power profiles&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer architecture knowledge of x86, ARM, RISC-V&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in board design, bring up, and validation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with electrical engineering design tools (e.g. schematic capture, layout)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Ubuntu development model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance engineering and security experience&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few roles based in offices. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder led, profitable and growing. We are hiring &lt;strong&gt;Python and Kubernetes Specialist Engineers focused on Data, Workflows, AI/ML and Analytics Solutions &lt;/strong&gt;to join our teams building open source solutions for public cloud and private infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer on the team, you&#39;ll collaborate on end-to-end data analytics and MLOps solutions composed of popular, open-source, machine learning tools, such as Kubeflow, MLFlow, DVC, and Feast. You may also work on ETL, data governance and visualization tools like Apache SuperSet, dbt, workflow orchestration tools such as Airflow and Temporal, or data warehouse solutions such as Apache Trino, or ClickHouse. These solutions may be run on servers or on the cloud, on machines or on Kubernetes, on developer desktops, or as web services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We serve the needs of individuals and community members as much as the needs of our Global 2000 and Fortune 500 customers; we make our primary work available free of charge and our Pro subscriptions are also available to individuals for personal use at no cost. Our goal is to enable more people to enjoy the benefits of open source, regardless of their circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This is a general track for security-focused engineering in every team at Canonical, across all levels of seniority. Apply here if you are already an exceptional security-focused software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most product engineering teams at Canonical include one or two spaces for dedicated security-oriented software engineers. Their role is to challenge the entire team to think more deeply about security. They contribute to the product as engineers too, but their primary focus is to improve security through state of the art practices - from table-top threat model exercises to architecture reviews, from extended security testing with fuzzers and static analysis tools to external security analyst liaison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also build a number of products that are entirely motivated by security technology and requirements, such as our AppArmor kernel investments and our hardening, compliance and certification toolkits for Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the publisher of Ubuntu we also handle long-term security response and hardening for the entire operating system and open source universe. Working with tens of thousands of upstreams means that we need to be fluent in every major programming language, and design, build and adopt sophisticated tools that enable us to work at scale and speed with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These roles encompass all aspects of product security, including feature development, vulnerability response, proactive security and open source community participation. All security roles interact closely with many of the other Canonical engineering and development teams, Canonical customers and our partners across the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location: We have open roles for security specialist software engineers in every timezone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you&#39;ll do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security roles might tackle any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define, implement and document new security features&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead security-oriented thinking in a product engineering team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze, fix, and test vulnerabilities in Canonical and open source Software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to Ubuntu and upstream projects to benefit the community&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audit and analyze source code for vulnerabilities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate new tools in our security infrastructure, pipelines and processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieve and retain various security certifications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend and enhance Linux cryptographic components - specifically with modules such as OpenSSL/Libgcrypt - with the features and functionality required for country-specific compliance such as FIPS and CC certification&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with external partners to develop CIS benchmarks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and develop hardening automation for Ubuntu&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor the security industry for new developments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, test and maintain new software capabilities&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide guidance and support to other engineering teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A thorough understanding of the common categories of security vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern engineering techniques to find and fix them&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with open source development tools and methodologies&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skill in one or more of C, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby or PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience as a security champion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience driving security within a wider SDLC process&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication and presentation skills&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Optional skills we also value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear and effective communication with the team and Ubuntu community members&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working with Linux Kernel&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Certification experience and knowledge in FIPS and/or CC&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with OVAL (Open Vulnerability Assessment Language)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of and familiarity with low-level Linux cryptography APIs&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated high learning ability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance engineering experience&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hiring Software Engineering Managers to lead technical teams in the various aspects of the delivery and ongoing support and maintenance of all Linux kernels provided by the Ubuntu Linux distribution.&amp;nbsp; As the Linux kernel itself is now quite broad, so are the technical domains and challenges involved, ranging from integrating support for bleeding-edge hardware into the latest Ubuntu kernels, to expanding the range of execution environments available to Ubuntu, to the complexities inherent in applying the latest fixes and updates to all of the &amp;gt;100 Ubuntu Linux kernels under active support during our Stable Release Update cycles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role would suit either an experienced manager of high performing software development teams, or a very proficient technical lead who is excited to take on a management responsibility. You will need to be passionate about Linux and aspire to be an integral part in its distribution to millions of users worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Engineering Manager at Canonical, your primary responsibility is to your team: helping them grow as engineers, do important and satisfying work, and have a great time while doing it. Technical leadership experience and a background in software engineering are necessary prerequisites for this role. You will be expected to lead, challenge, and develop strong engineers, positively influence the culture, facilitate technical delivery, and work with your team on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Working from home, worldwide.&amp;nbsp; We have kernel teams and openings in every time zone and with the notable exception of Taipei, Taiwan, have no offices and therefore no pressure to work from an office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role entails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leading a distributed team of software engineers in your geographic region in distinct aspects of delivery of all Linux kernels for the Ubuntu Linux distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking ownership of particular aspects of Ubuntu Linux which can include but not be limited to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with silicon or cloud partners to implement Linux kernels optimised for their execution environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring Ubuntu Linux is able to run on a wide range of diverse hardware platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition and execution of the stringent quality control standards expected by the Ubuntu user community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitigation of the latest security threats and exploits to the Linux kernel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong process automation as it pertains to the build, test, and delivery of the Linux kernel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engagement with other teams at Canonical, the open source community and commercial partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significant programming experience in C, with Python, Golang, or other like languages is also highly regarded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substantial experience with operating system kernel internals and concepts, Linux would be highly regarded but not essential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience managing or leading a team of software engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to coordinate between multiple distinct teams of differing technical focus to achieve common goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with version control practices, ideally with git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior experience developing with software packaging formats, with direct Ubuntu/Debian/Snap experience being highly regarded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel internationally twice a year for company events up to two weeks long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice-to-have skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience with kernel patching and debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong grasp of device drivers, BSP’s, and other low level system engineering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid background in driving CI/CD and process automation initiatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior public involvement with an open source project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual compensation review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognition rewards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual holiday leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maternity and paternity leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team Member Assistance Program &amp;amp; Wellness Platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity to travel to new locations to meet colleagues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priority Pass and travel upgrades for long-haul company events&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You’ll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow agile software development practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who you are&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You love technology and working with brilliant people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a Bachelor’s or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are an experienced Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation&lt;/li&gt;
