                &lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Aztec&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Aztec, our goal is to add privacy to Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get trustlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementing scalable encryption in a public blockchain paradigm requires cutting-edge math and engineering. Thankfully, our team of scientists and engineers invented Plonk, the industry-standard zkSNARK, and Noir, the universal language of zero knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we’re building a first of its kind Layer 2 with private smart contracts. This requires new cryptographic primitives, a zero-knowledge DSL for writing contracts, a privacy-friendly execution environment, a carefully designed set of circuits that prove the validity of the chain to L1, a decentralized block-building and proving mechanism, and a top-tier user and developer experience. And it’s now time to bring it to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve raised $125 million from industry-leading investors including a16z crypto, Paradigm, Variant, Consensys, and a_capital, and we’re growing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for entrepreneurial, impact-driven engineers who thrive in fast-paced environments and want to be at the forefront of privacy-first decentralized applications. You’ll be part of a highly collaborative team working on the client-side stack that powers Aztec&#39;s zero-knowledge execution environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design and build tools &amp;amp; SDKs&lt;/strong&gt; that enable developers to build powerful, privacy-preserving dApps on Aztec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a secure client-side execution environment&lt;/strong&gt;, used by wallets and applications to produce and handle encrypted transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architect reusable patterns and libraries&lt;/strong&gt; for writing auditable and verifiable Aztec smart contracts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate cross-functionally&lt;/strong&gt; with protocol, cryptography, and product teams to build end-to-end privacy-preserving applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactor, document, and test&lt;/strong&gt; existing code for maintainability, performance, and correctness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify and reduce technical debt&lt;/strong&gt;, while continuously improving architecture and developer ergonomics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We’re Looking For&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ years of professional software engineering experience in blockchain or cryptography-related systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep proficiency in &lt;strong&gt;TypeScript&lt;/strong&gt;, with strong software architecture and API design skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working knowledge of system-level concerns such as performance tuning, memory management, and secure data handling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Able to provide thoughtful code reviews and mentor other engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable working autonomously and asynchronously within a distributed team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Located in or able to work within &lt;strong&gt;GMT to EST time zones&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with &lt;strong&gt;Rust&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Solidity&lt;/strong&gt;, or other smart contract languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributions to open source projects, especially in the Web3 or cryptography space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with zk systems like ZCash or other privacy-preserving protocols.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure to modern web development frameworks and tooling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion for zero-knowledge cryptography and its role in reshaping the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Offer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible, &lt;strong&gt;remote-first culture&lt;/strong&gt; with HQ in London.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive salary + &lt;strong&gt;equity/token options&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25 days annual leave&lt;/strong&gt; + bank holidays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health, dental, and retirement benefits&lt;/strong&gt; (based on location).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quarterly offsites&lt;/strong&gt; for team collaboration and bonding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference and learning budget&lt;/strong&gt; for continual professional development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chance to work on &lt;strong&gt;truly cutting-edge zero-knowledge infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; with some of the best minds in the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aztec Labs is an equal opportunity employer and we value creativity, diversity, and intellectual curiosity. If you&#39;re passionate about leveraging your creative talents to make a real-world impact, and if you want to be part of a team that&#39;s shaping the future of digital privacy, then we would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
