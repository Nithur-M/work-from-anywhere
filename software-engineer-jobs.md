<h2><strong>Who we are</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that </span><a href="https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/strategy-goals/strategy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone can code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not just ~0.1% of the population. Our code intelligence platform helps developers and </span><a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with billions of lines of code create the software you use every day. By enabling more people to code, we believe we will create economic opportunity across the world and will drive progress that benefits everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs an exciting time to join Sourcegraph. Our business is growing rapidly: we‚Äôve experienced exponential growth and our </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$125M Series D from Andreessen Horowitz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$50M Series C from Sequoia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have given us the opportunity to make big ambitious bets on our future. We have a huge market (every company that builds software) and massive opportunity (most developers haven't even heard of code intelligence yet, but once you've used it, you can't live without it--just like Google). By continuing to hire exceptional people, we have the opportunity to make Sourcegraph one of the biggest technology companies in the world. </span></p></div>

    <h2><strong>Working hours</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that we are an all-remote company and hire </span><a href="https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/people-ops/process/how-we-engage-talent-outside-the-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost anywhere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the world, we don‚Äôt have a location requirement for this role.

Our go to definition and find references functionality helps engineers understand and navigate their code and dependencies as quickly as possible.&nbsp; Teams and product verticals within Sourcegraph are able to use Code Intelligence data to enhance or provide a deep technical moat to their offerings.&nbsp; Through this foundation many exciting avenues and innovations are spawned (dependency graph, global monorepo, security use cases, IDE navigation without local compilation).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our vision is to expand and support 40+ programming languages and build the global graph of open source code.&nbsp; We believe that we‚Äôre only just scratching the surface of what is possible within Code Intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a software engineer, you'll iterate on our customer experience, improve our language specific tooling and be an influential part of helping us build the global graph of code.</span></p>
