                We believe that the way people interact with their finances will drastically improve in the next few years. Weâre dedicated to empowering this transformation by building the tools and experiences that thousands of developers use to create their own products. Plaid powers the tools millions of people rely on to live a healthier financial life. We work with thousands of companies like Venmo, SoFi, several of the Fortune 500, and many of the largest banks to make it easy for people to connect their financial accounts to the apps and services they want to use. Plaidâs network covers 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada, UK and Europe. Founded in 2013, the company is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in New York, Salt Lake City, Washington D.C., London and Amsterdam. #LI-Remote

Unlocking financial freedom for everyone goes beyond building amazing APIs and intelligent tools for developers; it also means enabling consumers to easily control their data sharing and ensuring that every permission change is tracked and auditable. 

Our Financial Institution Authorization and Authentication team works closely with our partners to develop industry leading tools and APIs, ensuring that consumers have complete control over their data sharing. Beyond building solutions for Plaid stakeholders, we also work closely with industry groups to establish standards around data sharing.

As a software engineer on this team, you will be responsible for building, improving and designing products around authorization, authentication, and compliance for our data providers. You will collaborate directly with Plaidâs key partners to understand their most urgent problems and establish a well validated roadmap that will align Plaid with our key partners and lead to a better experience for consumers. 

This involves updating products, features, and services across our entire stack to ensure seamless experiences for our customers, consumers, and partners. It is the most mission-critical component of our infrastructure as it connects millions of bank accounts and billions of transactions to Plaid. 

Most of our backend core systems are written in Go, but that's not a prerequisite. We pick the right tool for the job and have systems in Go, TypeScript, and Python. 

We're guided by our principles, including impact, growing together, embracing openness and positivity, and inventing tomorrow; we're looking for people motivated by those same principles.




Plaid is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and values diversity at our company. We do not discriminate based on race, color, national origin, ethnicity, religion or religious belief, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, transgender status, sexual stereotypes, age, military or veteran status, disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.
