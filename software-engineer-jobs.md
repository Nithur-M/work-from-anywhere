  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> London, England, United Kingdom
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">https://www.overleaf.com</a>
</p>

<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p>Overleaf is a scaleup and social enterprise that builds modern collaborative authoring tools for scientists — like Google Docs for Science. We make an online, real-time collaborative editor for papers, theses and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language.</p>
<p>We have over 11 million registered users from around the world, over 400,000 people use our platform each day and we host over 100 million user-created projects. Our company is growing and we are looking for Software Engineers to help improve our platform.</p>
<p>We've been recognised as one of the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-recognized-as-one-of-the-uks-top-100-fastest-growing-businesses" class="external">UK's top 100 fastest growing businesses</a> and included in the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-makes-the-febe-growth-100-list" class="external">FEBE Growth 100 list</a>. We were <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-named-2020-saas-awards-winner" class="external"> Best SaaS for Nonprofits or Education</a> in the 2020 SaaS Awards Program, and a finalist in the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-named-finalist-in-digital-leaders-impact-awards-2022" class="external">Digital Leaders Impact Awards 2022</a>. We're part of the <a href="https://www.digital-science.com/" class="external">Digital Science</a> family of science, health and ed-tech companies.</p>
<p><strong>Our Tech</strong></p>
<p>Overleaf is based on open-source software, and most of our product code is open-source. You can find it on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf" class="external">https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf</a></p>
<p>On the backend, we run a microservices architecture, mainly in Node.js using MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Redis, running on Google Kubernetes Engine. On the front end, we mainly use React. </p>
<p><strong>Your New Role</strong></p>
<p>We are looking to hire a software engineer to help improve our platform. This is a complex web app that allows users to edit their scientific documents in collaboration with others, in real-time.</p>
<p>We are working on projects to improve our group collaboration features, which will include easier ways for groups to share projects, templates and files, and improving permissions' management. We're also planning to make our on-premises version easier to deploy and migrate more of our SaaS features into this product.</p>
<p>There will be opportunities to work on the frontend, so both backend and full-stack engineers are welcome to apply. (We also have openings for frontend engineers.)</p>
<p>As part of the engineering team at Overleaf, you will be helping to make Overleaf the go-to place for scientific writing.</p>
<p><strong>How We Work</strong></p>
<p>Overleaf is remote-first — all staff work remotely, and this is <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/about/values" class="external">part of our values</a>. We also have an office space in London for those that want to use it, and we get the whole team together a few times a year (usually in the UK) for face-to-face time.</p>
<p>Our core hours for meetings are 2pm-5pm UK time; we try to schedule all team meetings during this time, including daily 10-15 minute standup calls and biweekly company update calls.</p>
<p>We always collect user feedback to inform our work. We have UX professionals on our team, and we run many surveys and user interviews. Our engineers work closely with the product team in product trios (PM, engineer, UX) during both discovery and delivery of new features.</p>
<p>Our development process is based on the "Shape Up" model, using 6-week delivery cycles and a 4-week cooldown between them. In each cycle, we have multiple delivery tracks, each with its own tech lead. Engineers move between delivery teams each cycle. We practice code review, invest in automated testing and are big fans of linting.</p>
<p><strong>How We Hire</strong></p>
<p>The stages in our hiring process are typically:</p>
<ol> <li>We will aim to update you on the status of your application within 5 working days from when we receive it.</li> <li>We'll schedule a 30-minute call for a discussion with our Engineering Director to discuss the role and your experience, to see if they look like a good fit.</li> <li>We'll schedule a more in-depth interview, which is typically two hours long. The first hour is discussion, and the second hour is based on a short homework assignment (max 2h outside of interview) or an exercise during the interview if you prefer. The problems are practical in nature - no fizzbuzz, sorting linked lists or code golf.</li> <li>We'll make an offer. We usually interview in batches, so there may be a short delay while we interview other candidates, but we will keep you informed throughout the process.</li> </ol>
<p>If you have a deadline, please let us know in your application, and we will try to be accommodating.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<strong>To do this job well you'll need to:</strong><br><ul> <li>Have 2-3 years of experience working as a backend or full-stack engineer<ul><li>Experience with the technologies we use (like node.js) helps, but you don't need to know them all; your ability to learn is much more important to us.</li></ul> </li> <li>Be based in the US, Canada, the UK or Europe (EU member state)</li> <li>Usually be available in our core hours, 2pm-5pm UK time</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul> <li>Remote and flexible working.</li> <li>Salary up to £75k per year, depending on experience.</li> <li>You would join a small, dedicated and growing team.</li> <li>We're substantially (around 80%) open-source, so your work will often be on open-source code.</li> <li>We organize company and team meetups several times a year for valuable face-to-face time.</li> <li>We'll provide a new Mac, PC or Linux laptop, along with a stipend for other equipment.</li> <li>We provide a training budget and allocate time for training; many of our developers choose to attend relevant industry conferences or buy training materials.</li> <li>We run regular<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleafs-remote-hackathon-revisited-one-year" class="external"> remote hackathons</a> to keep learning and experimenting.</li> <li>We run a weekly internal seminar series with short talks from staff about their work or personal projects, new technologies and techniques.</li> <li>Additional benefits package varies by country. Please ask us.</li> </ul>
<p>We're an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status. Underrepresented groups often do not apply and we encourage them even if they do not meet all the requirements.</p>

We’re passionate about empowering people with their financial data in a flexible, private, and customizable format so they can take control of their future. <br><br>We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer with considerable operations engineering experience to accelerate our team’s adoption of best practices while contributing to product development as a key member of our cross-functional engineering team. Your perspective and track record of implementing modern, state-of-the-art site reliability engineering, CI/CD automation, and service architecture automation will be a force multiplier to our growing team of talented engineers. </div><div><br></div><div>You’ll take ownership of critical DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering projects and provide related mentorship, guidance, and domain expertise to your peers, delivering a reliable service  that will delight our customers now and as we continue to scale. You should have a deep understanding of distributed application service concepts, a propensity for figuring stuff out, and some additional depth in either back-end development, front-end development, or QA automation. You were born a problem solver and love finding efficient and durable ways to solve difficult problems.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></div><ul>
<li>Build secure solutions that honor the trust customers are placing in our service</li>
<li>Lead the development of operations engineering practices, including collaborating across the organization on capacity planning, service level objectives, error budgets and incident response outcomes</li>
<li>Collaborate with the rest of the team on a broad range of infrastructure and product development work</li>
<li>Evangelize the benefits of modern SRE and DevOps practices across the organization</li>
<li>Highlight and celebrate wins, as well as blamelessly assess failures from current and future attempts at implementing best practices such as CI/CD, observability, alerting and monitoring</li>
<li>Tenaciously dive into complex infrastructure as well as application code, figure it out, and improve or update it</li>
<li>Relentlessly share information, always leaving better code, practices, and documentation so it’s easier for others to understand your reasoning and follow your tracks</li>
<li>Be curious - troubleshoot operational issues when a customer is experiencing a quirky condition or when you or your teammates notice something isn’t quite right</li>
</ul><div>
<br><br>
</div><div><strong>Helpful For Success</strong></div><ul>
<li>Significant experience as an SRE or DevOps practitioner - you have experience building, operating, and troubleshooting complex applications using cloud infrastructure</li>
<li>Ideal candidates will have specific experience with Google Cloud Platform</li>
<li>Some experience with a good cross-section of our tech stack, including Google Cloud Platform, GitHub, Node.js, MongoDB, TypeScript, React, Google Apps Script/Editor Add-ons APIs and ecosystem, and Microsoft Office Add-ins APIs and ecosystem</li>
<li>Experience maintaining and refactoring legacy applications</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Why Tiller</strong></div><ul>
<li>We’re small and growing, so you’ll have tremendous agency and outsized impact on our developing culture, the Tiller service, and the success of our customers</li>
<li>You’ll be surrounded by awesome, supportive colleagues who know how to have fun together</li>
<li>We’ve been fully remote from day one; work from anywhere</li>
<li>You’ll have an opportunity to explore a broad range of development and operations tools, technologies, and practices; you won’t be siloed or pigeon-holed</li>
<li>You’ll have ongoing and repeated opportunities to pull up a seat at a lot of tables and wear multiple ‘hats’, depending on where your interests and capabilities lie; we have growth needs well beyond software development, and you’ll be close to them all, including IT, security, ops, customer support, product management, marketing </li>
<li>We’re pioneers in Open Banking, a world-wide security and privacy initiative that gives customers more control over what financial institution information they share, and with whom</li>
<li>Our customers tend to stick around - we have one of the highest customer retention rates among consumer fintech services</li>
<li>Our team also sticks around, and we have uniquely high retention</li>
<li>You will be eligible for stock options and equity ownership</li>
<li>We provide health care coverage</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Our Values</strong></div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>How we work together: </strong>Tiller is intent on making this a great place to work for our entire team. A place where our team can do their best work, and an environment that supports their full lives, from kids to aging parents, from nieces and nephews and their larger community. </div><div><br></div><div>To do this, four values that guide our work are empowerment, trust, engagement, and optimism. </div><div><br></div><div>We <strong>empower</strong> each other to do our best work. We value good judgment over rules; proactive decisions over approvals. We take ownership in our own productivity, knowing we’re all critical in the success of Tiller. We communicate openly, follow-through, and ask questions. </div><div><br></div><div>We depend on <strong>trust</strong> rather than oversight as a team. We rely on each other to make decisions in the interest of Tiller and our customers. We demonstrate positive intent so that others may presume positive intent. </div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>Engagement</strong> is the glue that holds us together. We know that communication across the wire is harder than in person, so we take risks in sharing more of ourselves with each other online. We enjoy a good laugh together. We also speak up and raise hard questions with each other. </div><div>
<br>As a team, we’re also <strong>optimistic</strong>. Despite what sometimes feels like a crushing backlog, a long list of ways we can deliver value to our customers, and a keen awareness of our shortcomings, we keep our focus on a future that is bright.</div>
