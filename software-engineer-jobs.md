                &lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under their own brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn, create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don&#39;t track hours, but we do manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones, are highly async, and like to document a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey, Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still more to come!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
