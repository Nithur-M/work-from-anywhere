<p>We enable commerce websites to increase their effectiveness through AI driven user experiences. Every company should be able to provide Amazon, Netflix, and TikTok level effectiveness without a massive AI team. Our customers love us because we increase their revenue with little effort and they don’t pay unless we deliver results.</p>
<p>The company raised $5 million from big_bets, RTP Global, and Angel Invest, with participation from Matthew Freud and the founders of digital commerce platform VTEX.</p>
<p><strong>Why Join Us?</strong></p>
<p>We are just about to enter a growth phase in the business which means we’re aggressively increasing our headcounts primarily across engineering and AI departments. The team size is about 40 people. You’ll work in close conjunction with the founding leadership - CTO and CEO, VP infrastructure, data science, and machine learning leaders.</p>
<p>Remote all the way</p>
<p>Forget the commute, work from anywhere in the world with other amazing people, enjoy getting together in person in beautiful places like our last get-together in Rio De Janeiro.</p>
