<li>Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community</li>
<li>Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code</li>
<li>Follow agile software development practices</li>
<li>Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights</li>
<li>Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values</li>
<li>Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who you are</h3>
<ul>
