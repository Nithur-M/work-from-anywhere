                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder led, profitable and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hiring &lt;strong&gt;2025 and 2026 Graduate Software Engineers&lt;/strong&gt; into engineering teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware, kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are excited about the potential that open source has for humanity and the enterprise, you have outstanding results in your academic career, and you are excited to contribute to the open source stack, this is the best way to apply to Canonical. We will work with you to identify teams and projects that would be interesting and a good fit for your skills and motivations. The process is highly competitive, it will require effort and excellence to succeed if you apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our engineering teams work from home. We try to align a single team in a single time zone - EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean), and AMER (North, South and Central Americas). Even though you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams that work well in the &#39;fishbowl&#39; of open source engineering. This is full time work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant responsibility. We don&#39;t generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep &#39;sprint&#39; with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a meaningful impact to open source, and see some very interesting new cities that you might never otherwise get to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find the open source stack amazing, and you have been a consistent high-performing student in your school and university, then this will be a challenging and exciting start to your career.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who We Are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpaca is a US-headquartered self-clearing broker-dealer and brokerage infrastructure for stocks, ETFs, options, crypto, fixed income, 24/5 trading, and more. Our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alpaca.markets/blog/alpaca-raises-52-million-in-series-c-funding-to-fuel-global-expansion-and-category-leadership/&quot;&gt;recent Series C funding round&lt;/a&gt; brought our total investment to over $170 million, fueling our ambitious vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpaca is proudly backed by top-tier global investors, including Portage Ventures, Spark Capital, Tribe Capital, Social Leverage, Horizons Ventures, Unbound, SBI Group, Derayah Financial, Elefund, and Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Team Members:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re a dynamic team of 230+ globally distributed members who thrive working from our favorite places around the world, with teammates spanning the USA, Canada, Japan, Hungary, Nigeria, Brazil, the UK, and beyond!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We&#39;re searching for passionate individuals eager to contribute to Alpaca&#39;s rapid growth. If you align with our core values—Stay Curious, Have Empathy, and Be Accountable—and are ready to make a significant impact, we encourage you to apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Your Role&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Senior Software Engineer on the Platform Team, you will be responsible for developing and maintaining the shared services that keep Alpaca running, including our Redpanda-based event streaming infrastructure and authentication and authorization systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for experienced developers who are not afraid to get their hands dirty with managing infrastructure. We own both client-facing and internal services, we maintain shared libraries, and we manage our own deployments. Most of our time is spent writing Go code, but we also work on Helm charts, analyze logs and metrics, manage our own deployments, and, in general, get called in to help with a large variety of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Things You Get To Do&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain and improve our Redpanda-based event streaming infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop the replacement for Alpaca’s aging authentication and authorization services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create event-driven solutions to replace batch processing all across our systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take ownership of tasks, identify and address technical challenges proactively, and propose innovative solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to architectural decisions, offering insights and suggestions for designing scalable and reliable systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with other teams to improve how our systems interact with theirs and improve Alpaca systems in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain good software quality and test coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in code reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Troubleshoot incidents and reported bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may be asked to be on-call to assist with engineering projects that are timely in nature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Who You Are (must-haves)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have &lt;strong&gt;5+ years of experience&lt;/strong&gt; writing code in strongly-typed languages, with at least &lt;strong&gt;one year of experience in Go&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with &lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/strong&gt; beyond the basics - you can write a &lt;strong&gt;Helm&lt;/strong&gt; chart for a new service with relative ease, you understand best practices around security, and you have prior job experience or certifications to prove this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have worked with relational databases before - we use &lt;strong&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/strong&gt;, but we are not particularly picky about this one as long as you have a solid grasp on the fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have worked at a &lt;strong&gt;startup&lt;/strong&gt; before - you understand that things don’t always go according to plan, that there is significant technical debt, that some tasks just need to be done, and that sometimes there are no processes or documentation to guide your hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not afraid of &lt;strong&gt;taking a task from start to finish&lt;/strong&gt; - gathering requirements, figuring out and implementing the best technical solution, then deploying and monitoring the results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have worked at least 3 years on systems at scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Who You Might Be (nice-to-haves)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You understand how &lt;strong&gt;Kafka&lt;/strong&gt; works - maybe you even worked with &lt;strong&gt;Redpanda&lt;/strong&gt; before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know what a &lt;strong&gt;JWT&lt;/strong&gt; token is, and how &lt;strong&gt;OpenID Connect&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;SAML&lt;/strong&gt; work. Maybe you even heard about &lt;strong&gt;Keycloak&lt;/strong&gt;, or have worked on authentication systems before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have done IaC deployments with &lt;strong&gt;Argo CD&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Terraform&lt;/strong&gt;, or have used &lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud Platform&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine&lt;/strong&gt; before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience with &lt;strong&gt;Grafana&lt;/strong&gt;’s observability stack - &lt;strong&gt;Prometheus&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Tempo&lt;/strong&gt; and all the rest. You might have even written a &lt;strong&gt;PromQL&lt;/strong&gt; query for a new alert once or twice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with &lt;strong&gt;FlatBuffers&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Protocol Buffers&lt;/strong&gt;, have written or consumed &lt;strong&gt;gRPC&lt;/strong&gt; services before, and can design simple &lt;strong&gt;RESTful APIs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How We Take Care of You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
