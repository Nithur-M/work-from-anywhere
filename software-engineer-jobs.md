<h2><span style="color: rgb(161, 18, 255);"><strong>Why this job is exciting</strong></span></h2>
<p>Source code is at the heart of Sourcegraph. We support multiple code hosts and retrieve, store, index, and serve source code - to end users, admins, and other internal services. Our latest addition to our product catalog, Cody, reimagines how code is written and supercharges our developer customers. Sourcegraph hosts the infrastructure for our customers to manage their source code (search, insights, own, etc.) and our brand new AI Code Assistant (Cody).</p>
<p>This role gives you the opportunity to solve complex, challenging, and highly technical problems for our customers, both internally and externally, help unleash the potential and productivity of our Engineering teams, and delight our customers with industry-leading quality software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cloud Operation team primarily focuses on building a fully managed platform for using Sourcegraph, Sourcegraph Cloud, our SaaS offering. As a member of the Cloud Ops team, you will work closely with both external customers and internal stakeholders to meet their needs. You will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop inter-cloud connectivity solutions to support enterprise customers from highly regulated industries to use Sourcegraph Cloud.</li>
<li>Build a control plane to orchestrate a fleet of single-tenant Sourcegraph Cloud instances.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Dive into upstream dependencies (e.g., CDK for Terraform, Terraform providers for GCP)&nbsp; to debug and patch non-trivial problems.</li>
<li>Be an advocate for building reliable services and work with leadership to help product teams achieve operational excellence.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Participate in on-call rotation to uphold our contractual SLA commitments.</li>
</ul>
<p>📅 Within one month, you will…</p>
<ul>
<li>Onboard onto the Sourcegraph architecture, tooling, and development workflow.</li>
<li>Build a solid understanding of the team’s areas of ownership, technical challenges, and problems the team solves for our customers, and know how all of these align with the top-level company goals.</li>
<li>Actively participate in team meetings, sharing ideas and insights to contribute to the overall team goals.</li>
<li>Start contributing to the team goals and deliverables by shipping new features, debugging issues, and fixing bugs.</li>

<p>📅 Within three months, you will…</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the Cloud infrastructure, its underlying technologies, and its integration within the Sourcegraph ecosystem.</li>
<li>Lead initiatives contributing to team goals through both discovery and delivery phases, collaborating directly with product and design partners, other engineering teams, and non-technical stakeholders from different departments.</li>
<li>Contribute to the architectural design and implementation of new features or improvements, actively shaping the future direction of Cloud infrastructure based on customer needs.</li>
<li>Lead initiatives contributing to team goals on the roadmap by going through the entire product development lifecycle discovery, design, implementation, and delivery.</li>
<li>Participate in our on-call rotation.</li>
</ul>
<p>📅 Within six months, you will…</p>
<ul>
<li>Be defining long-term technical vision and strategies for new product development, scaling existing services, and managing technical debt. These plans will consist of multiple smaller milestones, which you will deliver with the team iteratively.</li>
<li>Collaborate with the Engineering Manager on defining the team’s growth strategy based on the long-term product vision, the technical vision, and the team’s needs.</li>

</ul>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(161, 18, 255);"><strong>About you</strong></span></h2>
<p>You bring a product mindset in balancing architectural flexibility and philosophy with meeting immediate customer demand. You are an experienced software engineer who looks to solve problems through writing code rather than one-off operations. You are passionate about user experience and self-service. You balance maintaining and designing high-impact systems with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g., cut scope, low-tech vs. custom complex solutions) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Qualifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proficiency in Go, or other strongly typed languages.</li>
<li>Knowledge in one of the public cloud platform providers (GCP, AWS, Azure)</li>
<li>Experience with Terraform (or similar IaC solutions) and Kubernetes to build tooling and automation.</li>
<li>Skilled at debugging distributed systems followed by designing and implementing solutions to those problems. This means you should know your way around various OS-level primitives, e.g., network, CPU, and memory.</li>
<li>Ability to communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation.</li>
<li>Preferred time zone between UTC-8 and UTC+2</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to haves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built services and exposed them as API for external consumption&nbsp; (e.g., gRPC).</li>
<li>Comfortable implementing system-level software&nbsp; (e.g., custom transport protocol) if needed or has contributed to Kubernetes controllers/operators.</li>

      <p>This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels.</p>
<p>We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.</p>
<p>Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.</p>
<p>These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.</p>
<p>But while classic, ‘deb’ based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.</p>
<p>We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux and RTOS software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.</p>
<p>These roles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu Core and snapd software development&nbsp;</li>
<li>Silicon software and optimisation engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hardware-centric Linux QA Engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hardware Certification Engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Robotics engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Industrial IoT software engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)</li>
</ul>
<p>At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We're looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.</p>
<p>Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.</p>
<h2>What your day will look like</h2>
<p>Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with the latest Linux kernel, RTOS, and open source technologies</li>
<li>Deliver Ubuntu for the latest IoT and server-class hardware platforms</li>
<li>Integrate and maintain device-oriented software stacks</li>
<li>Write high-quality, well-designed software</li>

<li>Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations</li>
<li>Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path</li>
<li>Passion for embedded systems software (e.g. kernel, graphics, Yocto, RTOS)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fluency in at least one of Golang, C, C++, or Rust&nbsp;</li>
<li>Professional written and spoken English&nbsp;</li>
<li>Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&nbsp;</li>

      <p>This is a general track for security-focused engineering in every team at Canonical, across all levels of seniority. Apply here if you are already an exceptional security-focused software engineer.</p>
<p>Most product engineering teams at Canonical include one or two spaces for dedicated security-oriented software engineers. Their role is to challenge the entire team to think more deeply about security. They contribute to the product as engineers too, but their primary focus is to improve security through state of the art practices - from table-top threat model exercises to architecture reviews, from extended security testing with fuzzers and static analysis tools to external security analyst liaison.</p>
<p>We also build a number of products that are entirely motivated by security technology and requirements, such as our AppArmor kernel investments and our hardening, compliance and certification toolkits for Ubuntu.</p>
<p>As the publisher of Ubuntu we also handle long-term security response and hardening for the entire operating system and open source universe. Working with tens of thousands of upstreams means that we need to be fluent in every major programming language, and design, build and adopt sophisticated tools that enable us to work at scale and speed with confidence.</p>
<p>These roles encompass all aspects of product security, including feature development, vulnerability response, proactive security and open source community participation. All security roles interact closely with many of the other Canonical engineering and development teams, Canonical customers and our partners across the open source community.</p>
<p>Location: We have open roles for security specialist software engineers in every timezone.</p>

<li>Analyze, fix, and test vulnerabilities in Canonical and open source Software</li>
<li>Contribute to Ubuntu and upstream projects to benefit the community&nbsp;</li>
<li>Audit and analyze source code for vulnerabilities&nbsp;</li>
<li>Integrate new tools in our security infrastructure, pipelines and processes</li>
<li>Achieve and retain various security certifications&nbsp;</li>
<li>Extend and enhance Linux cryptographic components - specifically with modules such as OpenSSL/Libgcrypt - with the features and functionality required for country-specific compliance such as FIPS and CC certification&nbsp;</li>
<li>Work with external partners to develop CIS benchmarks</li>
<li>Design and develop hardening automation for Ubuntu&nbsp;</li>
<li>Monitor the security industry for new developments&nbsp;</li>
<li>Develop, test and maintain new software capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

      <p>Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.</p>
<p>We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical.

&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We’re a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country. This is the dream that drove Wences Casares, our Founder and Chairman, to quietly transform the world of banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Although we are headquartered in Gibraltar, this is a full time, 100% remote position&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position Overview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a seasoned Software Engineer to join our engineering function. At Xapo, we are building truly cross-functional teams with full ownership of design, architecture, building, testing, delivery, data, and operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will collaborate closely with fellow team members from the product, apps, design, and QA communities of practice. You will be part of the product team (we call them SATs, the Stream Aligned Teams, as in the Team Topologies) in charge of the Financial Crime Prevention products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Software Engineer, you will develop a high-impact service, provide guidance and coaching around technical good practices, and play an active, critical role in the Development Community of practice. You will shape architectural and technical patterns used in the company to solve the problems for operational teams, improve UX, and cause a WOW effect in the eyes of our Members. With that in mind, you will have an immense impact on how the future of finance looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support, coach, and develop team members into top-performing engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work closely in cross-functional teams where everyone is responsible for the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a great place to work for talented and motivated people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design, develop, and deploy backend services focusing on high availability, fault tolerance, low latency, and security.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Develop innovative solutions with Bitcoin at its core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills needed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significant software engineering experience in one or more general-purpose programming languages (we use Python).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent teamwork and communication skills, comfortable preparing high-quality documentation and designs to aid understanding and knowledge sharing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of microservices architecture, container-based 12-factor apps, and cloud-native patterns around fault tolerance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track record of using Event Storming and Domain-Driven Design, delivering highly scalable asynchronous software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience building contract-first services and adopting patterns and frameworks to enable appropriate automated testing at the unit, contract, service, and end-to-end levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience building services that can be deployed on demand, quickly, and with quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent understanding of CI/CD patterns and good practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the role of high-quality observability in building highly scalable and performant software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dedicated workspace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reliable internet connection with the fastest speed possible in your area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devices and other essential equipment that meet minimal technical specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alignment with Our Values and the Xapo Values-Driven Leadership principles.&lt;/li&gt;

Set your own work schedule and make use of a flexible PTO plan when you need to recharge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expect Excellence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt; Collaborate, learn, and grow with a high-performance team.

&lt;/ul&gt;
