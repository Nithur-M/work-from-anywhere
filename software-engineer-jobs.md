    <h2><span style="color: rgb(140, 51, 236);"><strong>Working hours</strong></span></h2>
<p>🌎 Given that we are an all-remote company and hire <a href="https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/people-ops/process/how-we-engage-talent-outside-the-us/">almost anywhere</a> in the world, we don’t have a location requirement for this role. However, this person will be needed to work 4pm to 10pm UTC Monday to Friday.</p>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(140, 51, 236);"><strong>Why this job is exciting</strong></span></h2>
<p>Cody is an AI coding assistant that lives in your editor that can find, explain, and write code. Cody uses LLMs and the Sourcegraph search engine and code graph, providing answers that eliminate toil and keep human programmers in flow. You can think of Cody as your programmer buddy who has read through all the code on GitHub, all the questions on StackOverflow, and all your organization’s private code, and is always there to answer questions you might have or suggest ways of doing something based on prior knowledge.</p>
<p>The Cody Strategic team is aimed at turning the largest, most world-recognizable brands into Cody Champions. We do this by partnering with a small number of highly engaged <a href="https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/strategy-goals/strategy/#market-segmentation">strategic customers</a> to build product functionality that enables these customers to successfully deploy the most-loved coding assistant, but at massive scale. You will work closely with the ML Infrastructure team, all the Cody teams across Cody’s e2e service stack, and teams across Sourcegraph to bring the best-of-class coding assistant to your favorite big brands. The Strat team focuses on one or two projects at a time, delivers and scales them, and then works to hand them off to the other Cody teams so that it just becomes part of how Cody is operated. This is high-impact work and has the attention of the entire company. You will be supported by Eng, Design, Product, Legal and the go-to-market teams, and you are joining a team of very talented and experienced engineers who have already accomplished amazing things in a short time. They will be there to help you hit the ground running and guide your work.</p>
<p>📅 Within one month, you will…</p>
<ul>
<li>Start building a trusting relationship with your peers, and learning the company structure.</li>
<li>Be set up to do local development, and be actively prototyping.</li>
<li>Ship a substantial new feature to end users.</li>
</ul>
<p>📅 Within three months, you will…</p>
<ul>
<li>Be seen as a subject matter expert in all things Cody at Sourcegraph.</li>
<li>Be contributing actively to the world’s best coding assistant.</li>
<li>Be following all the relevant research, and conducting research of your own.</li>
</ul>
<p>📅 Within six months, you will…</p>
<ul>
<li>Be fully ramped up and able to anticipate the needs of strategic customers.</li>
<li>Be ramped up on other relevant parts of the Sourcegraph product.</li>
<li>Be helping design and build what might become the biggest dev accelerator in 20 years.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(140, 51, 236);"><strong>About you</strong></span></h2>
<p>You are a full-stack software engineer with at least 2 years of industry experience, equally comfortable with frontend and backend work as needed, with the ability to pick up frameworks quickly and deliver high-quality work. Ideally, you have worked directly with enterprise customers as a SaaS developer. Or perhaps you have worked with internal customers on large cross-functional projects. You should enjoy cross-functional, cross-company collaboration, since that is the bread and butter of the Cody Strat team.</p>
<p>Our Strat customers are typically deployed with complex legacy configurations, and we often need to build bridges into those systems. Much of the Strat work is becoming ML-oriented in nature, as our investment in Cody AI increases and our Strat customers become early adopters. LLMs and their ecosystem are at the core of Cody’s architecture, so you ideally have prior experience working with LLM-based applications, and should be seeking to increase your knowledge of AI/ML as the space quickly evolves.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfortable with developing and deploying software and services on at least one major Cloud provider, with preference for experience with GCP, as most of your Cloud work will be on GCP.</li>
<li>Comfortable with at least the basics of Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, and systems programming</li>
<li>Experience with Go (minimum) and in an ideal world, TypeScript, Java, and various scripting languages</li>
<li>You have used Cody and understand Cody’s current architecture, and you have your own opinions about the directions it could and should go next.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice-to-haves: <em>(All optional, but each would enable you to have even higher impact.)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Postgres. If you have very deep Postgres experience, you may be in luck.</li>
<li>Node.js. Cody’s cross-client logic is largely in Node.js, and being able to contribute there is helpful.</li>
<li>Understanding of the modern LLM ecosystem especially as it pertains to coding and AI assistants, including the basics of prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications.</li>
<li>Understanding of compiler construction, and experience working with tools that work with code. We have a code graph that is central to Cody’s operation, and you may be working with it at scale.</li>
<li>Frontend programming with React. If you have this specialty, it’s often in demand on this team, e.g. for delivering new administrative workflows and user onboarding experiences.</li>
<li>Rust. More and more of our code is being written in Rust, and you may need to fiddle with it at some point.</li>
<li>Kotlin and Java Swing, since one of our flagship Cody clients is IntelliJ, and it is often in need of Enterprise-specific features to help close large deals.</li>
<li>Plugin development with Neovim or Emacs. Our Strat customers come in all shapes and sizes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Successfully evolve the release process into a mature platform, enabling teams across Sourcegraph to manage their releases independently.</li>
<li>Proactively propose additions and changes to the team's roadmap, aligning it with the broader goals of Sourcegraph.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(140, 51, 236);"><strong>About you</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>You’re a software engineer first, but you have a passion for working on the boundaries between software and the underlying infrastructure. You might have some past experience as an SRE, developing tooling for other developers, or jumping between the two.</li>
<li>You're just as comfortable designing distributed systems as you are methodically debugging a complex performance issue with skills you have honed from years of experience.</li>
<li>You understand the software lifecycle, from design, to coding, to docs, as well as the maintenance lifecycle over time. You've experienced it in its entirety at least once in your career.</li>
<li>You don't write code for the sake of it, but to provide value to our customers by solving problems.</li>
<li>You value integrity and teamwork. Your strong sense of empathy helps you understand your peers' challenges and you sharply understand how to balance solving current and future problems, carving a path to implement your vision. You're able to work effectively across teams to solve complex problems with multiple stakeholders.</li>
<li>You understand your role in the company and how you contribute to its success or failures. You have a strong sense of ownership and a healthy sense of urgency. You&nbsp; understand that this is <strong>your</strong> company now.</li>
<li>Your sense of ownership extends to the software that you ship to your customers. You understand that your code is likely the first impression many customers have of your company, and you often pause to consider the customer experience during development.</li>
<li>You do work you are proud of and your work is respected by your peers as well as the broader community.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li>You're highly proficient at writing Go and likely experienced in other languages as well.</li>
<li>You've had experience setting up delivery and build pipelines of various sizes. You know the challenges of shipping software at scale and how to overcome them.</li>
<li>You have deep knowledge of Kubernetes, including working and developing with Kubernetes APIs and internals such as CRDs and controllers.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> You have experience with database internals and complex schema migrations.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> You have worked with Bazel or other build systems in large polyglot codebases.</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't matter if you're not an expert on all points, what really counts is that you understand the complexities of releasing software, and thrive to make it a seamless experience for both our customers and our teammates. Ultimately, you can jump in at any point in the software lifecycle and understand how to fix issues.&nbsp;</p>
