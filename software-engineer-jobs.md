&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Build tooling and documentation to help customers (both internal and external) quickly address common issues the moment they arise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Provide subject-matter expertise on PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB for internal stakeholders, including other engineering teams and technical support team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
