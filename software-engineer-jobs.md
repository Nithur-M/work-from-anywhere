<p>Our rapid development pace means that building and releasing our products to the market is a unique challenge, from overseeing the release of all components supporting Cody as well as Cody itself, building the tools to provide a self-service experience to all teammates, to taking part in building a quality infrastructure to monitor Cody quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are looking for a Senior Release Engineer to join the Developer Infrastructure team to take our release process to the next level, turning it into a seamless process for everyone, maximizing the ownership of individual teams with a platform based approach.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(140, 51, 236);"><strong>About you</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>You’re a software engineer first, but you have a passion for working on the boundaries between software and the underlying infrastructure. You might have some past experience as an SRE, developing tooling for other developers, or jumping between the two.</li>
<li>You're just as comfortable designing distributed systems as you are methodically debugging a complex performance issue with skills you have honed from years of experience.</li>
<li>You understand the software lifecycle, from design, to coding, to docs, as well as the maintenance lifecycle over time. You've experienced it in its entirety at least once in your career.</li>
<li>You don't write code for the sake of it, but to provide value to our customers by solving problems.</li>
<li>You value integrity and teamwork. Your strong sense of empathy helps you understand your peers' challenges and you sharply understand how to balance solving current and future problems, carving a path to implement your vision. You're able to work effectively across teams to solve complex problems with multiple stakeholders.</li>
<li>You understand your role in the company and how you contribute to its success or failures. You have a strong sense of ownership and a healthy sense of urgency. You&nbsp; understand that this is <strong>your</strong> company now.</li>
<li>Your sense of ownership extends to the software that you ship to your customers. You understand that your code is likely the first impression many customers have of your company, and you often pause to consider the customer experience during development.</li>
<li>You do work you are proud of and your work is respected by your peers as well as the broader community.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li>You're highly proficient at writing Go and likely experienced in other languages as well.</li>
<li>You've had experience setting up delivery and build pipelines of various sizes. You know the challenges of shipping software at scale and how to overcome them.</li>
<li>You have deep knowledge of Kubernetes, including working and developing with Kubernetes APIs and internals such as CRDs and controllers.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> You have experience with database internals and complex schema migrations.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> You have worked with Bazel or other build systems in large polyglot codebases.</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't matter if you're not an expert on all points, what really counts is that you understand the complexities of releasing software, and thrive to make it a seamless experience for both our customers and our teammates. Ultimately, you can jump in at any point in the software lifecycle and understand how to fix issues.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels.</p>
<p>We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.</p>
<p>Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.</p>
<p>These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.</p>
<p>But while classic, ‘deb’ based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.</p>
<p>We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux and RTOS software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.</p>
<p>These roles include:</p>

<li>Hardware Certification Engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Robotics engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Industrial IoT software engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)</li>
</ul>
<p>At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We're looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.</p>
<p>Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.</p>
<h2>What your day will look like</h2>
<p>Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:</p>

      <p>This is a general track for security-focused engineering in every team at Canonical, across all levels of seniority. Apply here if you are already an exceptional security-focused software engineer.</p>
<p>Most product engineering teams at Canonical include one or two spaces for dedicated security-oriented software engineers. Their role is to challenge the entire team to think more deeply about security. They contribute to the product as engineers too, but their primary focus is to improve security through state of the art practices - from table-top threat model exercises to architecture reviews, from extended security testing with fuzzers and static analysis tools to external security analyst liaison.</p>
<p>We also build a number of products that are entirely motivated by security technology and requirements, such as our AppArmor kernel investments and our hardening, compliance and certification toolkits for Ubuntu.</p>
<p>As the publisher of Ubuntu we also handle long-term security response and hardening for the entire operating system and open source universe. Working with tens of thousands of upstreams means that we need to be fluent in every major programming language, and design, build and adopt sophisticated tools that enable us to work at scale and speed with confidence.</p>
<p>These roles encompass all aspects of product security, including feature development, vulnerability response, proactive security and open source community participation. All security roles interact closely with many of the other Canonical engineering and development teams, Canonical customers and our partners across the open source community.</p>

      <p>Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.</p>
<p>We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.</p>
