&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating developers &lt;/strong&gt;with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

However, if you feel qualified, we welcome you to apply regardless of location. No matter what, working hours must overlap with PST for at least 20 hours/week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preferred locations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this job is exciting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source code is at the heart of Sourcegraph. We support multiple code hosts and retrieve, store, index, and serve source code - to end users, admins, and other internal services. Our latest addition to our product catalog, Cody, reimagines how code is written and supercharges our developer customers. Sourcegraph hosts the infrastructure for our customers to manage their source code (search, insights, own, etc.) and our brand new AI Code Assistant (Cody).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role gives you the opportunity to solve complex, challenging, and highly technical problems for our customers, both internally and externally, help unleash the potential and productivity of our Engineering teams, and delight our customers with industry-leading quality software.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Operation team primarily focuses on building a fully managed platform for using Sourcegraph, Sourcegraph Cloud, our SaaS offering. As a member of the Cloud Ops team, you will work closely with both external customers and internal stakeholders to meet their needs. You will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop inter-cloud connectivity solutions to support enterprise customers from highly regulated industries to use Sourcegraph Cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a control plane to orchestrate a fleet of single-tenant Sourcegraph Cloud instances.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expose complex infrastructure as API to support internal customers to iterate faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dive into upstream dependencies (e.g., CDK for Terraform, Terraform providers for GCP)&amp;nbsp; to debug and patch non-trivial problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an advocate for building reliable services and work with leadership to help product teams achieve operational excellence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in on-call rotation to uphold our contractual SLA commitments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within one month, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard onto the Sourcegraph architecture, tooling, and development workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a solid understanding of the team’s areas of ownership, technical challenges, and problems the team solves for our customers, and know how all of these align with the top-level company goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively participate in team meetings, sharing ideas and insights to contribute to the overall team goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start contributing to the team goals and deliverables by shipping new features, debugging issues, and fixing bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within three months, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the Cloud infrastructure, its underlying technologies, and its integration within the Sourcegraph ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead initiatives contributing to team goals through both discovery and delivery phases, collaborating directly with product and design partners, other engineering teams, and non-technical stakeholders from different departments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the architectural design and implementation of new features or improvements, actively shaping the future direction of Cloud infrastructure based on customer needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead initiatives contributing to team goals on the roadmap by going through the entire product development lifecycle discovery, design, implementation, and delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in our on-call rotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within six months, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be defining long-term technical vision and strategies for new product development, scaling existing services, and managing technical debt. These plans will consist of multiple smaller milestones, which you will deliver with the team iteratively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with the Engineering Manager on defining the team’s growth strategy based on the long-term product vision, the technical vision, and the team’s needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek feedback from customers and stakeholders to identify opportunities for further improvements or new features, actively iterating on the Cloud infrastructure to ensure it continues to meet our high bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bring a product mindset in balancing architectural flexibility and philosophy with meeting immediate customer demand. You are an experienced software engineer who looks to solve problems through writing code rather than one-off operations. You are passionate about user experience and self-service. You balance maintaining and designing high-impact systems with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g., cut scope, low-tech vs. custom complex solutions) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in Go, or other strongly typed languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge in one of the public cloud platform providers (GCP, AWS, Azure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Terraform (or similar IaC solutions) and Kubernetes to build tooling and automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skilled at debugging distributed systems followed by designing and implementing solutions to those problems. This means you should know your way around various OS-level primitives, e.g., network, CPU, and memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferred time zone between UTC-8 and UTC+2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built services and exposed them as API for external consumption&amp;nbsp; (e.g., gRPC).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable implementing system-level software&amp;nbsp; (e.g., custom transport protocol) if needed or has contributed to Kubernetes controllers/operators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published blog posts and/or tech talks about your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on small high-performing teams, preferably tech startups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Develop a roadmap and tooling for abuse detection and mitigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend and operate analytics services collecting data around usage metering, license management, billing, and rate limiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within one month, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard onto the Sourcegraph architecture, tooling, and development workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a solid understanding of the team’s areas of ownership, technical challenges, and problems the team solves for our customers, and know how all of these align with the top-level company goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively participate in team meetings, sharing ideas and insights to contribute to the overall team goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start contributing to the team goals and deliverables by shipping new features, debugging issues, and fixing bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within three months, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate an understanding of the Cody Prime service stack, its underlying technologies, and its integration within the Sourcegraph ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the implementation of new features or improvements in Go, with occasional opportunities to work on front-end features using JavaScript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in initiatives contributing to team goals on the roadmap by going through the entire product development lifecycle discovery, design, implementation, and delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in support of our production services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within six months, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate a deep understanding of the Cody Gateway and Cody Analytics products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute new features to both services with assistance from senior engineers on the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with teams across the company on projects that benefit from cross-team expertise, particularly those involving monetization or analytics of the Cody product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bring a product mindset in balancing design philosophy with meeting customer demand, balancing the requirements of enterprise-grade production services with the rapid iteration requirements of the AI space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think in terms of building self-service platforms and APIs, which reduce manual operations and enable other developers. You balance maintaining and designing high-impact systems with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g., cut scope, low-tech vs. custom complex solutions) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary. You’re excited to work in a new space, bringing enterprise-grade security to an AI chat product. You are strongly aligned with &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcegraph.notion.site/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d&quot;&gt;our values&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by our mission to make it so that everyone can code, and motivated to do your best work at Sourcegraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear and empathetic communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in Go (or other strongly typed languages with a desire, willingness, and ability to quickly ramp up on effective Go.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General knowledge about deploying/managing/utilizing services in Cloud environments (GCP, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD, etc. or similar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skilled at architecting, debugging, building, testing, and reasoning about moderately complex distributed systems which intersect APIs and Services provided by other teams &amp;amp; companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable reasoning about API performance, service monitoring, metrics, alerting, etc. in moderately complex distributed systems (writing such code, and general intuition skills around OS primitives like network/CPU/memory, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eagerness to help and assist other internal (and occasionally external) engineers with the institutional knowledge you will help build on the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on small high-performing teams, preferably tech startups, or a strong desire to join a fast-paced async team environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your working hours overlap with 9am-5pm &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.is/PT&quot;&gt;PT&lt;/a&gt; for at least 15 hours per week so we have time to collaborate synchronously when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with monitoring/alerting technologies such as: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, OpsGenie, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with API technologies such as: HTTP text streams, WebSockets, REST, gRPC, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable developing services that fit broader organizational preferences (neither micro-services nor monoliths, balancing and reasoning about such tradeoffs.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General familiarity with payment processing, authentication, etc. technologies or a desire to learn their usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with, or an eagerness to learn about, interacting with most AI/LLM APIs in the world, their nuances and intricacies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating developers &lt;/strong&gt;with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bring a product mindset in balancing design philosophy with meeting customer demand, balancing the requirements of enterprise-grade production services with the rapid iteration requirements of the AI space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think in terms of building self-service platforms and APIs, which reduce manual operations and enable other developers. You balance maintaining and designing high-impact systems with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g., cut scope, low-tech vs. custom complex solutions) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary. You’re excited to work in a new space, bringing enterprise-grade security to an AI chat product. You are strongly aligned with &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcegraph.notion.site/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d&quot;&gt;our values&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by our mission to make it so that everyone can code, and motivated to do your best work at Sourcegraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear and empathetic communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in Go (or other strongly typed languages with a desire, willingness, and ability to quickly ramp up on effective Go.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General knowledge about deploying/managing/utilizing services in Cloud environments (GCP, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD, etc. or similar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skilled at debugging, building, testing, and reasoning about moderately complex distributed systems which intersect APIs and Services provided by other teams &amp;amp; companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable reasoning about API performance, service monitoring, metrics, alerting, etc. in moderately complex distributed systems (writing such code, and general intuition skills around OS primitives like network/CPU/memory, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with, or an eagerness to learn about, interacting with most AI/LLM APIs in the world, their nuances and intricacies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eagerness to help and assist other internal (and occasionally external) engineers with the institutional knowledge you will help build on the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your working hours overlap with 9am-5pm &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.is/PT&quot;&gt;PT&lt;/a&gt; for at least 15 hours per week so we have time to collaborate synchronously when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on small high-performing teams, preferably tech startups, or a strong desire to join a fast-paced async team environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with monitoring/alerting technologies such as: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, OpsGenie, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with API technologies such as: HTTP text streams, WebSockets, REST, gRPC, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable developing services that fit broader organizational preferences (neither micro-services nor monoliths, balancing and reasoning about such tradeoffs.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General familiarity with payment processing, authentication, etc. technologies or a desire to learn their usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating developers &lt;/strong&gt;with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating developers &lt;/strong&gt;with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating developers &lt;/strong&gt;with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(161, 18, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                <p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
<p>MixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Security.</p>
<p>Team is 40 full-time, full-remote from 20+ countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.</p>
<p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.</p>
<p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.</p>
<p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.</p>
<p><strong>Who we’re looking for</strong></p>
<p>We're hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning/data science, data transformation/ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more. We'll cater the role to whatever subset of these areas match your interests.</p>

      <p>This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels.</p>
<p>We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.</p>
<p>Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.</p>
<p>These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.</p>
<p>But while classic, ‘deb’ based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.</p>
<p>We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.</p>
<p>These roles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu Core and snapd software development&nbsp;</li>
<li>Silicon software and optimisation engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers&nbsp;</li>

<li>Hardware Certification Engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Robotics engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Industrial IoT software engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)</li>
</ul>
<p>At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We're looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.</p>
<p>Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.</p>
<h2>What your day will look like</h2>
<p>Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with the latest Linux kernel, RTOS, and open source technologies</li>
<li>Deliver Ubuntu for the latest IoT and server-class hardware platforms</li>
<li>Integrate and maintain device-oriented software stacks</li>

<p>We also build a number of products that are entirely motivated by security technology and requirements, such as our AppArmor kernel investments and our hardening, compliance and certification toolkits for Ubuntu.</p>
<p>As the publisher of Ubuntu we also handle long-term security response and hardening for the entire operating system and open source universe. Working with tens of thousands of upstreams means that we need to be fluent in every major programming language, and design, build and adopt sophisticated tools that enable us to work at scale and speed with confidence.</p>
<p>These roles encompass all aspects of product security, including feature development, vulnerability response, proactive security and open source community participation. All security roles interact closely with many of the other Canonical engineering and development teams, Canonical customers and our partners across the open source community.</p>

<li>Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code</li>
<li>Follow agile software development practices</li>
<li>Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights</li>
<li>Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values</li>
<li>Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who you are</h3>
<ul>
<li>You love technology and working with brilliant people</li>
<li>You have a Bachelor’s or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree</li>

<li>You are an experienced Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects</li>
<li>You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation</li>
<li>You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software</li>
</ul>
<h3>About Canonical</h3>

                <h3><strong>About Atticus</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">At any given time, 16 million Americans are experiencing a crisis that requires urgent help from our legal system or government. The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We've helped more than 20,000 people in need (see our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com">6,000+ five-star reviews</a>) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We just closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 52 to 91 last year and we expect to grow again in 2024.</p><h3><strong>The Job</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">To provide a great experience for a client, we have to do a lot quickly: Understand their situation, identify their needs, give advice, match them with the right lawyer, connect them to that lawyer, convince both parties to work together, and formalize the arrangement — all while doing our best to make a complex and scary system feel simple, accessible, and human. We’ve managed to do all of this in a way that users love, but we’ve done it by leaving some parts of the process quite manual... which means we can only scale so far.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Your job is to change that: to lead the effort to transform our product into a platform that can serve millions of people. You'll craft a strategic plan and roadmap that will enable our tech stack to scale 10x in volume we currently support and plant the seeds for 20x. The role mixes engineering strategy, architectural decisions, and people management. You will focus on leading a cross-functional team focused on building a highly performant, intuitive and secure client experience on the web for Atticus clients, lawyers, and our internal teams.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">You will work with our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethicsmatters/">VP of Engineering</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-behr-a9a5948/">COO</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-abrahams-443a4366/">Director of Product</a> but work across many teams (including product, design, lawyer network, as well as client experience and marketing). </p><h3><strong>What You'll Do</strong></h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Help your team design, build and operate Atticus’ APIs with a focus on performance and reliability</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Plan roadmaps 3-6 months ahead but are deeply engaged on week to week operations. </p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Evaluate storage technologies and methodologies with an eye toward scalability and performance</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Architect, design, review, and test code in a collaborative environment with other software engineers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Leverage your team as multipliers for your skills to create excellent products and services</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Train other technical leaders on the team to do as you do.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>What You Need</strong></h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You've been the best engineer in the room before and you know how to get others there.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You've led engineering teams with success on highly critical products.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’ve been leading engineering teams for 5+ years.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You love fostering career growth and building a strong team culture.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You care deeply about operational excellence (incident management, resilient systems, high availability, etc.)</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You proactively identify problems and opportunities and generate creative approaches to solve them.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You're a champion of end user products and passionately collaborate with product and design.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.</p><h3><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">15 vacation days &amp; 16 paid holidays each year</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$1,000/year reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work </p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">401(k) and optional HSA</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Free snacks, drinks, weekly lunches, and regular team dinners/events/retreats</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Location</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p>
