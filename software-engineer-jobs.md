                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speechify is the easiest way to listen to the world’s information.&lt;/strong&gt; Articles on the web, documents in the cloud, books on your phone. We absorb it all and let you listen to it at your desk, on the go, at your own speed, and with tools that make learning easier, deeper, and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What streaming services have done for audio entertainment, we’re doing for audio information. And whatever we’re doing seems to be working. We’re #1 in our category, and experiencing exponential growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-speechify-sentence=&quot;&quot;&gt;We&#39;re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our Core Experiences Team. This team builds and maintains the foundational services and SDKs that power Speechify’s product experience across platforms. It&#39;s a critical role for someone who enjoys working at the intersection of product and infrastructure, thinks strategically, and is passionate about designing clear, reliable APIs and simple systems that directly enhance the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Yo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;u’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Collaborate with Speechify’s Product Teams to scope projects, find ways to reduce scope to get faster feedback from customers, navigate the integration/UX tradeoffs relevant to different product teams, and deliver solutions via our cross-platform SDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Optimize existing functionality to ship things like faster loading and more intelligent parsing by designing more efficient abstractions and improving our algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Ship cloud functions, lightweight backend services, and jobs using Kotlin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Ideal Candidate Should Have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systems thinking. You know that optimizing a system requires end-to-end design, and you believe simplicity is valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Speed. You work quickly to generate ideas and options and know how to decide which things can ship now and what things need time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Focus. We’re a high-growth startup with a busy, remote team. You know how and when to engage or be heads down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Collaboration. You know how to inspire, play, and negotiate with opinionated designers, marketers, and PMs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Preferred Tech Stack:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;1&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Kotlin Multiplatform (Java experience is OK but role is Kotlin Multiplatform)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;1&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Prior experience with GCP is a plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-speechify-sentence=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Offer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fast-growing environment where you can help shape the company and product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An entrepreneurial-minded team that supports risk, intuition, and hustle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hands-off management approach so you can focus and do your best work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An opportunity to make a big impact in a transformative industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive salaries, a friendly and laid-back atmosphere, and a commitment to building a great asynchronous culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity to work on a life-changing product that millions of people use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build products that directly impact and support people with learning differences like dyslexia, ADD, low vision, concussions, autism, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in one of the fastest growing sectors of tech, the intersection of artificial intelligence and audio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation&lt;/strong&gt;: The US base salary range for this full-time position is $140,000-$200,000 + bonus + equity depending on experience&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder led, profitable and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hiring &lt;strong&gt;2024 and 2025 Graduate Software Engineers&lt;/strong&gt; into engineering teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware, kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are excited about the potential that open source has for humanity and the enterprise, you have outstanding results in your academic career, and you are excited to contribute to the open source stack, this is the best way to apply to Canonical. We will work with you to identify teams and projects that would be interesting and a good fit for your skills and motivations. The process is highly competitive, it will require effort and excellence to succeed if you apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our engineering teams work from home. We try to align a single team in a single time zone - EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean), and AMER (North, South and Central Americas). Even though you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams that work well in the &#39;fishbowl&#39; of open source engineering. This is full time work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant responsibility. We don&#39;t generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep &#39;sprint&#39; with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a meaningful impact to open source, and see some very interesting new cities that you might never otherwise get to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find the open source stack amazing, and you have been a consistent high-performing student in your school and university, then this will be a challenging and exciting start to your career.&lt;/p&gt;
