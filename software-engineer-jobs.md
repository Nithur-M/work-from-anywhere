                &lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under their own brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn, create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don&#39;t track hours, but we do manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones, are highly async, and like to document a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey, Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still more to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://careers.circle.so/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://careers.circle.so/&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;Careers&lt;/a&gt; page for more about working at Circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About the role&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Applied AI team at Circle is at the forefront of leveraging AI to drive innovation for our customers through transformative applications of large language models (LLMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for a strong full-stack engineer who is proficient in web frameworks, backend development, and infrastructure to spearhead the development of full-stack AI solutions across Circle. You will work on exciting projects such as AI agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, AI evaluations and observability, and building infrastructure for LLM inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While deep AI specialization or expertise isn&#39;t required, we care about hands-on experience building AI features. Beyond that, we’re looking for a strong experimentation mindset. If you&#39;re excited about rapidly testing ideas, running A/B experiments, and iterating on real production use cases of LLMs, this role is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Applied AI team is composed of different backgrounds. Some team members joined with deep Rails experience and solid AI fundamentals, while other team members joined with deep AI experience and ramped up on Rails. Either path works as long as you bring hands-on experience with both Rails and AI, and have genuine curiosity to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you&#39;ll be doing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ship full-stack AI projects end-to-end on a product built in Ruby on Rails backend and React frontend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and run experiments (including A/B tests, AI evaluations, or others) to validate AI features, measure impact, and guide iteration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and integrate components for AI infrastructure and optimize them for performance and reliability to support production-level inferencing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve processes, tools, and systems to scale AI features into production-ready solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help us stay up-to-date with the cutting-edge AI research, techniques, and tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work closely with Circle&#39;s leaders and designers throughout the feature design process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foster a bias for action by prioritizing speed of iteration, experimentation, and learning, while maintaining high standards of code quality and user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you&#39;ll need to be successful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6+ years experience&lt;/strong&gt; working as a full-stack engineer on high-traffic production applications. You&#39;ve dealt with the challenges that come with scale — query optimization, careful migrations, performance bottlenecks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong proficiency in &lt;strong&gt;Ruby on Rails, MySQL / Postgresql, ReactJS&lt;/strong&gt;. Familiarity with both frontend and backend is necessary, but a high degree of proficiency in both is not a requirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hands-on experience building AI features in production — whether RAG systems, AI agents, or LLM-powered tools. You&#39;ve shipped at least one real AI use case, not just prototypes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong experimentation mindset — you’re comfortable designing and running A/B tests, measuring results, and iterating quickly to discover what works and what doesn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A desire to work in an environment which values speed of iteration and individual autonomy, while also embracing personal accountability and the ability to collaborate effectively as part of a dynamic team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable in a fast-paced environment with a certain level of ambiguity, especially when learning and picking up new technologies when projects require it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong alignment with our values,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://circle.so/careers&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;find our values on our career page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;if you haven’t read up on them yet.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$130,000 - $140,000 USD per year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In addition to equity, benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and increase on a once per year basis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The fun stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fully remote:&amp;nbsp;work from anywhere in the world!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Generous U.S. benchmarked compensation&amp;nbsp;and startup equity no matter where you are in the world.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awesome medical coverage&amp;nbsp;with 100% coverage for you and your family, or medical reimbursement options where applicable!*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parental leave&amp;nbsp;for parents expanding their family, or just starting one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home office stipend&amp;nbsp;to help you get up and running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning &amp;amp; development stipend&amp;nbsp;to help you level up your professional skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual bonus potential&amp;nbsp;for roles that don&#39;t already receive variable income or commission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company retreats:&amp;nbsp;Twice a year, the Circle team gets together for a fully paid company retreat in incredible places around the world! We’ve had past retreats in Colombia, Portugal, and Mexico, with more planned on the horizon.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a seasoned full-stack engineer to join Circle’s Payments team and help expand the monetization engine that powers thousands of community-based businesses. You’ll work across both &lt;strong&gt;infrastructure and product surfaces&lt;/strong&gt; — from integrating payment providers and scaling checkout flows, to building high-converting paywalls, upsells, and subscription tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A core focus of this role is building and evolving Circle’s &lt;strong&gt;billing and invoicing engine&lt;/strong&gt;, including managing subscription plans, schedules, invoicing, proration, and billing workflows. We’re looking for someone who has &lt;em&gt;lived through&lt;/em&gt; building or operating these systems and understands their technical and business complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hands-on role with broad scope. You’ll own features end-to-end: system design, implementation across the stack, payment gateway integrations, and close collaboration with product and design to ship reliable, polished experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re excited about &lt;strong&gt;scaling critical systems, crafting seamless checkout and monetization flows, and empowering creators to grow globally&lt;/strong&gt;, this role is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you&#39;ll be doing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work autonomously across our Ruby on Rails backend and React front-end to ship high-quality features quickly and safely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead complex projects end-to-end, driving architectural and product decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and scale our subscription billing and invoicing platform, including multiple pricing structures, plan changes, proration, invoicing, and full subscription lifecycle events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anticipate and design for common billing edge cases such as partial periods, legacy pricing, tax/VAT integration, and failed payments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and evolve monetization features like paywalls, upsells, affiliate tools, and subscription settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate and scale payment solutions (e.g. Stripe, PayPal, in-app payments) to support global audiences, multiple currencies, and diverse business models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize checkout and paywall experiences for reliability, conversion, and UX.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with leadership, product, and design from early exploration through launch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuously improve performance, developer experience, and code quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balance iteration speed with technical and UX excellence, shipping behind feature flags when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you&#39;ll need to be successful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong alignment with our values (see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://circle.so/careers&quot;&gt;careers page&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in English (spoken, written, and reading) at CEFR Level C2 / ILR Level 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5+ years of experience building and maintaining complex full-stack web applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced proficiency in Ruby on Rails, MySQL/PostgreSQL, React, TypeScript, CSS/SCSS, and TailwindCSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct experience building, scaling, or operating a subscription billing and invoicing system in production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hands-on experience integrating and maintaining payments in live environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong product mindset with a focus on user outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senior-level ownership mindset with the ability to lead engineering-heavy, high-impact initiatives with significant autonomy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfort operating in a fast-paced, remote-first environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on a fully distributed team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonus points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with advanced Stripe features (Connected Accounts, Subscriptions, Invoicing, Subscription Schedules).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with billing and invoicing platforms such as Outseta, Maxio, or Metronome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background working with community platforms, creator tools, or other user-first SaaS products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track record of building polished, detail-oriented interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$130,000 - $140,000 USD per year&lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under their own brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn, create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don&#39;t track hours, but we do manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones, are highly async, and like to document a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey, Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still more to come!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;About the role&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a Senior Full-Stack Engineer to join our Growth Engineering team. This team drives some of Circle’s most critical initiatives: billing and plan infrastructure, trial and onboarding flows, A/B experimentation, and now — expanding into analytics and member experiences. With millions of members engaging across Circle communities, the work you do here will have an outsized impact. If you thrive in a data-driven environment, love refining experiences to feel seamless and intuitive, and want to help scale the systems that power growth at Circle, this role is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What you’ll be doing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shipping often and with care, balancing speed with thoughtful, quality work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owning end-to-end projects — from concept and development to rollout and measurable results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partnering with engineers, designers and product leaders to craft member experiences that feel beautiful, simple, and premium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scaling our billing infrastructure to support both self-service and sales-led use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing and implementing A/B tests to validate changes that boost user acquisition, retention, and expansion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building world-class analytics that empower community owners with deep insights to understand and grow their communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing event instrumentation for each initiative to ensure impact can be tracked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What you’ll need to be successful&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven track record of shipping customer-facing or consumer-facing experiences and solving hard problems.&lt;/li&gt;
