                &lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under their own brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn, create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don&#39;t track hours, but we do manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones, are highly async, and like to document a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey, Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still more to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://careers.circle.so/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://careers.circle.so/&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;Careers&lt;/a&gt; page for more about working at Circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re hiring two senior full-stack engineers to join our CMS organization — one on CMS Core and one on CMS Builder. These teams are responsible for some of the most critical and widely-used surfaces across Circle’s product. CMS Core owns our core community features like discussions, courses, the Home feed, search, and digests. CMS Builder is behind our powerful new site builder, enabling customers to create beautiful, custom web experiences with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

                <details><summary>Description</summary>
                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder led, profitable and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hiring &lt;strong&gt;2025 and 2026 Graduate Software Engineers&lt;/strong&gt; into engineering teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware, kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are excited about the potential that open source has for humanity and the enterprise, you have outstanding results in your academic career, and you are excited to contribute to the open source stack, this is the best way to apply to Canonical. We will work with you to identify teams and projects that would be interesting and a good fit for your skills and motivations. The process is highly competitive, it will require effort and excellence to succeed if you apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our engineering teams work from home. We try to align a single team in a single time zone - EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean), and AMER (North, South and Central Americas). Even though you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams that work well in the &#39;fishbowl&#39; of open source engineering. This is full time work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant responsibility. We don&#39;t generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep &#39;sprint&#39; with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a meaningful impact to open source, and see some very interesting new cities that you might never otherwise get to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find the open source stack amazing, and you have been a consistent high-performing student in your school and university, then this will be a challenging and exciting start to your career.&lt;/p&gt;
