<p>Brave is on a mission to protect the human right to privacy online. We’ve built a free web browser that blocks creepy ads and trackers by default, a private search engine with a <em>truly</em> independent index, a browser-native crypto wallet, and a private ad network (opt-in!) that directly rewards you for your attention. And we’re just getting started. Already over 90 million people have switched to Brave for a faster, more private web. Millions more switch every month.</p>
