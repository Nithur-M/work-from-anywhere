</p>

<div>We are a remote startup (headquartered in Canada) building a smart, curious, and driven team that’s making software to help sales reps sell better.</div><div>
<br>Prospect is a lead generation app that helps you find contact data right inside your browser in real-time. The best sales teams from the top tech companies in the world use Prospect to crush their sales targets.</div><div><strong><br>MORE ABOUT US</strong></div><div>
<br>We are currently a team of 15 people -- you will be #16 🙂</div><div>
<br>We are self-funded and profitable (no VCs or investors). We did this because we want to do what’s best for our team and customers.</div><div>
<br>Authoritative leadership style is practiced here, where the overall goal is given and you have the freedom to choose your own way of achieving it.</div><div>
<br>We have balanced working hours (~8 hours/day), don’t work weekends, and take ample time off. We don’t have any “managers” and we rarely do any internal meetings.</div><div><strong><br>ABOUT YOU</strong></div><div>
<br>You enjoy writing beautiful code. You care not just about whether the code works, but you think deeply about how well it performs, and how it will be understood by future developers.</div><div>
<br>You like shipping things. You realize that building excellent products is a marathon, not a sprint, and regularly make improvements in iterations.</div><div>
<br>You are an excellent communicator. You realize that working remotely requires thoughtful communication and you do so through great written communication.</div><div>
<br>You self-manage and are open to feedback. You enjoy taking a goal and figuring out how to ship it without heavy direction and regular check-ins.</div><div>
<br>You are product and customer-centric. Whether it is a bug fix, perf improvement, or a new feature, you realize that every line of code is an opportunity to make a user’s experience better.</div><div><strong><br>OUR ENGINEERING TEAM RIGHT NOW</strong></div><div>
