Tell us about something you've made that you're proud of. Tell us something you think is interesting/cool about Discourse the software. We expect applicants to have created an account on try.discourse.org, and welcome any suggestion on how you would improve the experience from a developer point of view.</em></p><p><br></p>
<p class="h2">About the job</p>
<p>Discourse is looking to hire a frontend specialist. We are looking for someone with a passion to build user interfaces and make our product better every day, with a strong focus on quality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The majority of the work you will do will be open source, and you will communicate with our users openly on Discourse Meta.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Discourse is primarily a hosting company. Some of your focus will be around resolving issues for customers, or assisting with customer-specific themes, plugins, and other customizations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Applicants will have a 10-40 hour paid trial project (over 2-10 weeks) prior to joining the team. The trial project usually involves adding a feature to Discourse or a Discourse plugin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="h4">Your responsibilities will include:</p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">Developing, testing, and documenting features for Discourse</li>
<li style="">Creating and maintaining reusable components to facilitate building user interfaces</li>
<li style="">Correcting bugs in Discourse, and working with legacy code in an established codebase</li>
<li style="">Documenting and clearly communicating fixes and features requests that are completed</li>
<li style="">Working with design and product colleagues when planning and implementing work</li>
<li style="">Assisting with pre-sales, support, and operations as needed</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p class="h4">We’re looking for someone who: </p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">Has extremely good JavaScript and web API knowledge, Ruby/Rails experience is a plus, SQL is a plus</li>
<li style="">Maintains a positive mindset and actively improves the code beyond its original state</li>
<li style="">Is passionate about open source and comfortable with public code reviews</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Discourse is made with the Ember.js framework, knowing the framework is a plus, but not mandatory, we can help you learn it. If you have experience in other JavaScript frameworks or libraries it will be helpful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are also careful about the accessibility of our product, and would consider a plus a candidate with a good knowledge of accessibility on the web.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At Discourse, the ability to communicate well in writing is paramount. We use our own software, Discourse, for most communication and most of your interaction with customers and team members will be in writing. In order to live these values, we look for folks who are:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="">
<li style="">Detail-oriented, proactive, and organized</li>
<li style="">Able to make decisions quickly and communicate effectively</li>
<li style="">Work well independently and remotely</li>
<li style="">Kind to their co-workers</li>
<li style="">Highly driven with an execution focus and a strong belief in our mission to make the internet a better place</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p class="h2">About our Pay &amp; Benefits</p>
<p>We believe that high-quality benefits make our team more effective. We’ve been thoughtful about our benefits package which includes a completely flexible schedule, 5 weeks of vacation per year, funding for a co-working stipend, and much more!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our Salary Framework is location and experience based, and we’re happy to provide a range up front. We also give every employee a stake in the success of the business, regardless of seniority or role. All full-time employees are eligible to receive equity options in the company as part of our equity incentive program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly, we believe in having a welcoming workplace where people with diverse backgrounds and cultures can create something great together. We encourage you to apply, even if you don’t meet every qualification!

&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating developers &lt;/strong&gt;with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

However, if you feel qualified, we welcome you to apply regardless of location. No matter what, working hours must overlap with PST for at least 20 hours/week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating developers &lt;/strong&gt;with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hours &amp;amp; location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;We build a high-performance, high-efficiency stack for window managers and display subsystems in C++, called Mir. We&#39;re growing the team and looking for new colleagues who share our passion for precision, performance and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to enable the whole spectrum of graphics from single-purpose screens through edge devices to full desktop environments.

                &lt;p&gt;This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology on autonomous devices across all seniority levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world&#39;s most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while classic, ‘deb’ based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These roles include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu Core and snapd software development&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silicon software and optimisation engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware-centric Linux QA Engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware Certification Engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robotics engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industrial IoT software engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We&#39;re looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What your day will look like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with the latest Linux kernel and open source technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliver Ubuntu for the latest IoT and server-class hardware platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate and maintain device-oriented software stacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write high-quality, well-designed software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate proactively with other globally distributed teams&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display technical leadership internally and within our external communities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help our customers ship their apps and SDKs on Ubuntu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build device OS images with Ubuntu Core, Desktop and Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimise the Ubuntu kernel and libraries for silicon-specific capabilities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debug issues and produce high-quality code to fix them&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to technical documentation to make it the best of its kind&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss ideas and collaborate on finding good solutions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate as technical lead on complex customer engagements involving complete system architectures from cloud to edge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work usually from home, with global travel 2 to 4 weeks for company events&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion for Linux or embedded systems software (e.g. kernel, graphics, Yocto)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluency in at least one of Golang, C, C++, or Rust&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication and presentation skills&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional skills that you might also bring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Debian/Ubuntu or other distro packaging&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of build systems and toolchains, including for cross-compilation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with firmware, uboot, UEFI, ACPI, DSDT, or boot loaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with power management on PCI ASPM, SATA ALPM, low power profiles&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer architecture knowledge of x86, ARM, RISC-V&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in board design, bring up, and validation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with electrical engineering design tools (e.g. schematic capture, layout)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Ubuntu development model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance engineering and security experience&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shell or Python scripting skills&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we offer you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual compensation review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognition rewards&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This is a general track for security-focused engineering in every team at Canonical, across all levels of seniority. Apply here if you are already an exceptional security-focused software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most product engineering teams at Canonical include one or two spaces for dedicated security-oriented software engineers. Their role is to challenge the entire team to think more deeply about security. They contribute to the product as engineers too, but their primary focus is to improve security through state of the art practices - from table-top threat model exercises to architecture reviews, from extended security testing with fuzzers and static analysis tools to external security analyst liaison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also build a number of products that are entirely motivated by security technology and requirements, such as our AppArmor kernel investments and our hardening, compliance and certification toolkits for Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the publisher of Ubuntu we also handle long-term security response and hardening for the entire operating system and open source universe. Working with tens of thousands of upstreams means that we need to be fluent in every major programming language, and design, build and adopt sophisticated tools that enable us to work at scale and speed with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These roles encompass all aspects of product security, including feature development, vulnerability response, proactive security and open source community participation. All security roles interact closely with many of the other Canonical engineering and development teams, Canonical customers and our partners across the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location: We have open roles for security specialist software engineers in every timezone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you&#39;ll do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security roles might tackle any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define, implement and document new security features&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead security-oriented thinking in a product engineering team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze, fix, and test vulnerabilities in Canonical and open source Software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to Ubuntu and upstream projects to benefit the community&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audit and analyze source code for vulnerabilities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate new tools in our security infrastructure, pipelines and processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieve and retain various security certifications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend and enhance Linux cryptographic components - specifically with modules such as OpenSSL/Libgcrypt - with the features and functionality required for country-specific compliance such as FIPS and CC certification&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with external partners to develop CIS benchmarks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and develop hardening automation for Ubuntu&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor the security industry for new developments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, test and maintain new software capabilities&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide guidance and support to other engineering teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A thorough understanding of the common categories of security vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern engineering techniques to find and fix them&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with open source development tools and methodologies&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skill in one or more of C, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby or PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience as a security champion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience driving security within a wider SDLC process&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication and presentation skills&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Optional skills we also value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experience with OVAL (Open Vulnerability Assessment Language)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of and familiarity with low-level Linux cryptography APIs&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated high learning ability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance engineering experience&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we offer you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This is the general track for Engineering Director at Canonical, apply here if you are confident to run a project which spans teams and time zones, hiring and managing engineering managers and staff engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical’s largest software products are built by multiple teams working together under a single director of engineering. Once you have passed the first round of interviews we will discuss specific software products which would be a good fit for your interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and enterprise compute. Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of ‘most software to most companies’. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering directors set the pace and the direction to help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though this is a senior management position, managing managers, we expect Engineering Directors to be outstanding developers with the confidence to lead by example across the full range of activities in their teams. You need to understand what great code looks like in the language and genre of your product - whether that is a web service, or a system daemon, or a desktop application, or a distributed system. You’ll need to know how to drive testing and benchmarking to improve the clarity in your teams around quality and performance. You’ll also need to be confident to set and defend high expectations of work ethic, consistency, focus and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You’ll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow agile software development practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who you are&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You love technology and working with brilliant people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a Bachelor’s or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are an experienced Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About Canonical&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, “the world’s best free software platform”. Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations.

&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We’re a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country. This is the dream that drove Wences Casares, our Founder and Chairman, to quietly transform the world of banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Although we are headquartered in Gibraltar, this is a full time, 100% remote position&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 500;&quot;&gt;Work from anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You will be part of the product team (we call them SATs, the Stream Aligned Teams, as in the Team Topologies) in charge of the Onboarding, Marketing and Customer&amp;nbsp;Service aspects of Xapo products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Software Engineer, you will develop a high-impact service, provide solutions with good practices, and play an active role in the Development Community of practice. You will collaborate in discussions about architectural and technical patterns used in the company to solve problems for operational teams, improve UX, and create a WOW effect in the eyes of our members.

&lt;p&gt;Diversity is at the heart of who we are at Xapo Bank. We’re a fully distributed team of over 140 Xapiens that work remotely from 40+ countries around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country. This is the dream that drove Wences Casares, our Founder and Chairman, to quietly transform the world of banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, we search the world for the best people for the job. We work hard, think globally, and inspire each other to learn and grow. We are committed to changing the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk is inherent in all of our business activities and managing risk well is the responsibility of every Xapien. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver value for our shareholders, and helps make Xapo a great place to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <h3><strong>About Atticus</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">At any given time, 16 million Americans are experiencing a crisis that requires urgent help from our legal system or government. The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We've helped more than 20,000 people in need (see our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com">6,000+ five-star reviews</a>) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We just closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 52 to 91 last year and we expect to grow again in 2024.</p><h3><strong>The Job</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">To provide a great experience for a client, we have to do a lot quickly: Understand their situation, identify their needs, give advice, match them with the right lawyer, connect them to that lawyer, convince both parties to work together, and formalize the arrangement — all while doing our best to make a complex and scary system feel simple, accessible, and human. We’ve managed to do all of this in a way that users love, but we’ve done it by leaving some parts of the process quite manual... which means we can only scale so far.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Your job is to change that: to lead the effort to transform our product into a platform that can serve millions of people. You'll craft a strategic plan and roadmap that will enable our tech stack to scale 10x in volume we currently support and plant the seeds for 20x. The role mixes engineering strategy, architectural decisions, and people management. You will focus on leading a cross-functional team focused on building a highly performant, intuitive and secure client experience on the web for Atticus clients, lawyers, and our internal teams.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">You will work with our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethicsmatters/">VP of Engineering</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-behr-a9a5948/">COO</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-abrahams-443a4366/">Director of Product</a> but work across many teams (including product, design, lawyer network, as well as client experience and marketing). </p><h3><strong>What You'll Do</strong></h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Help your team design, build and operate Atticus’ APIs with a focus on performance and reliability</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Plan roadmaps 3-6 months ahead but are deeply engaged on week to week operations. </p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Evaluate storage technologies and methodologies with an eye toward scalability and performance</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Architect, design, review, and test code in a collaborative environment with other software engineers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Leverage your team as multipliers for your skills to create excellent products and services</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Train other technical leaders on the team to do as you do.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>What You Need</strong></h3><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You've been the best engineer in the room before and you know how to get others there.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You've led engineering teams with success on highly critical products.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You’ve been leading engineering teams for 5+ years.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You love fostering career growth and building a strong team culture.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You care deeply about operational excellence (incident management, resilient systems, high availability, etc.)</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You proactively identify problems and opportunities and generate creative approaches to solve them.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You're a champion of end user products and passionately collaborate with product and design.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em">We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.</p><h3><strong>Salary and Benefits</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:</p><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">15 vacation days &amp; 16 paid holidays each year</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Free membership to OneMedical</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$1,000/year reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work </p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">401(k) and optional HSA</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Free snacks, drinks, weekly lunches, and regular team dinners/events/retreats</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Location</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.</p>

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speechify is the easiest way to listen to the world’s information. Articles on the web, documents in the cloud, books on your phone. We absorb it all and let you listen to it at your desk, on the go, at your own speed, and with tools that make learning easier, deeper, and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What streaming services have done for audio entertainment, we’re doing for audio information. And whatever we’re doing seems to be working. We’re #1 in our category, and experiencing exponential growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Be scrappy to find new sources of audio data and bring it into our ingestion pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operate and extend the cloud infrastructure for our ingestion pipeline, currently running on GCP and managed with Terraform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate closely with our Scientists to shift the cost/throughput/quality frontier, delivering richer data at bigger scale and lower cost to power our next-generation models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with others on the AI Team and Speechify Leadership to craft the AI Team’s dataset roadmap to power Speechify’s next-generation consumer and enterprise products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experience with web crawlers, large-scale data processing workflows is a plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to handle multiple tasks and adapt to changing priorities.&lt;/li&gt;
