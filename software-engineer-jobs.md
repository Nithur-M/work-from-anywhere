      <p>This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels.</p>
<p>We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.</p>
<p>Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.</p>
<p>These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.</p>
<p>But while classic, ‘deb’ based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.</p>
<p>We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux and RTOS software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.</p>
<p>These roles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu Core and snapd software development&nbsp;</li>
<li>Silicon software and optimisation engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hardware-centric Linux QA Engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hardware Certification Engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Robotics engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Industrial IoT software engineers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)</li>
</ul>
<p>At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We're looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.</p>
<p>Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.</p>
<h2>What your day will look like</h2>
<p>Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with the latest Linux kernel, RTOS, and open source technologies</li>
<li>Deliver Ubuntu for the latest IoT and server-class hardware platforms</li>
<li>Integrate and maintain device-oriented software stacks</li>
<li>Write high-quality, well-designed software</li>
<li>Collaborate proactively with other globally distributed teams&nbsp;</li>
<li>Display technical leadership internally and within our external communities&nbsp;</li>

<p>Most product engineering teams at Canonical include one or two spaces for dedicated security-oriented software engineers. Their role is to challenge the entire team to think more deeply about security. They contribute to the product as engineers too, but their primary focus is to improve security through state of the art practices - from table-top threat model exercises to architecture reviews, from extended security testing with fuzzers and static analysis tools to external security analyst liaison.</p>
<p>We also build a number of products that are entirely motivated by security technology and requirements, such as our AppArmor kernel investments and our hardening, compliance and certification toolkits for Ubuntu.</p>
<p>As the publisher of Ubuntu we also handle long-term security response and hardening for the entire operating system and open source universe. Working with tens of thousands of upstreams means that we need to be fluent in every major programming language, and design, build and adopt sophisticated tools that enable us to work at scale and speed with confidence.</p>
<p>These roles encompass all aspects of product security, including feature development, vulnerability response, proactive security and open source community participation. All security roles interact closely with many of the other Canonical engineering and development teams, Canonical customers and our partners across the open source community.</p>
