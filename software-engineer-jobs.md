&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kit.com/&quot;&gt;Kit &lt;/a&gt;is an email-first operating system for creators who mean business. We help creators grow and monetize their audience with ease. For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn&#39;t a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products — all within one platform. More importantly, there isn&#39;t a team more committed to helping creators earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform. We have always been 100% independent and 100% remote. We are proud to have built a product that our customers love, and we look for people who have enthusiasm and belief in our mission, vision, and values to join our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re also embracing AI thoughtfully — both in how we build and how we hire to ensure our team is adaptable, innovative, and ready for what&#39;s next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kit culture is one where emotional intelligence is valued, radical candor is encouraged, and where everyone works together to uphold a set of shared team principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⏰&amp;nbsp;The deadline to apply is 11:59 PM Pacific Time on Monday, June 9th.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to apply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that most people hate interviewing (we relate!). We aim to make it as good of an experience as we can, and part of that includes keeping you informed during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can expect from the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 min - Recruiter screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;45 min - Hiring manager screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take-home technical assessment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;75 min - Technical interview&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 min - Leadership &amp;amp; execution interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, complete this application, including answers to the questions on the next page.&lt;strong&gt; We read every single application, and your responses to our application questions help put your experience into context. &lt;/strong&gt;We’ll keep you informed through every step&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity in all of its forms, and we hire the best person we can for each role, no matter your personal background. Research tells us that applicants who are female or non-binary, as well as applicants who are people of color, are less likely to apply for roles they do not feel 100% qualified for. If you think you meet more than 50% of our requirements but fewer than 100% of them, please apply. We’re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn’t apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to apply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that most people hate interviewing (we relate!). We aim to make it as good of an experience as we can, and part of that includes keeping you informed during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can expect from the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kit is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity in all of its forms, and we hire the best person we can for each role, no matter your personal background. Research tells us that applicants who are female or non-binary, as well as applicants who are people of color, are less likely to apply for roles they do not feel 100% qualified for. If you think you meet more than 50% of our requirements but fewer than 100% of them, please apply. We’re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn’t apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kit.com/&quot;&gt;Kit &lt;/a&gt;is an email-first operating system for creators who mean business. We help creators grow and monetize their audience with ease. For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn&#39;t a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products — all within one platform. More importantly, there isn&#39;t a team more committed to helping creators earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform. We have always been 100% independent and 100% remote. We are proud to have built a product that our customers love, and we look for people who have enthusiasm and belief in our mission, vision, and values to join our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re also embracing AI thoughtfully — both in how we build and how we hire to ensure our team is adaptable, innovative, and ready for what&#39;s next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kit culture is one where emotional intelligence is valued, radical candor is encouraged, and where everyone works together to uphold a set of shared team principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⏰&amp;nbsp;The deadline to apply is 11:59 PM Pacific Time on Monday, June 9th.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a &lt;strong&gt;Senior Software Engineer II&lt;/strong&gt; to build Kit’s core publishing platform and creator growth experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be joining the Builders team, which builds the suite of publishing tools creators use to create emails, landing pages, and newsletters. Our team is responsible for creators&#39; first experiences in the app, from onboarding, to activation, and conversion. And we steward Kit’s core application experience and component library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hands-on role for a product-minded engineer who thrives collaborating with Product and Design to craft beautiful and impactful user experiences. You’re a technical leader who can architect extensible systems end-to-end across the stack, with particular strength on the frontend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your support system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll report to the &lt;strong&gt;Engineering Manager&lt;/strong&gt; who leads the Builders team, a cross-functional product team at Kit. You&#39;ll collaborate closely with a &lt;strong&gt;Product Manager, Product Designer, Quality Assurance Engineer, and peer Software Engineers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll also have access to a group of Engineers across Kit for support and mentorship, and will start with a peer onboarding buddy who will help you navigate our systems and codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder led, profitable and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hiring &lt;strong&gt;2024 and 2025 Graduate Software Engineers&lt;/strong&gt; into engineering teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware, kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are excited about the potential that open source has for humanity and the enterprise, you have outstanding results in your academic career, and you are excited to contribute to the open source stack, this is the best way to apply to Canonical. We will work with you to identify teams and projects that would be interesting and a good fit for your skills and motivations. The process is highly competitive, it will require effort and excellence to succeed if you apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our engineering teams work from home. We try to align a single team in a single time zone - EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean), and AMER (North, South and Central Americas). Even though you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams that work well in the &#39;fishbowl&#39; of open source engineering. This is full time work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant responsibility. We don&#39;t generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep &#39;sprint&#39; with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a meaningful impact to open source, and see some very interesting new cities that you might never otherwise get to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find the open source stack amazing, and you have been a consistent high-performing student in your school and university, then this will be a challenging and exciting start to your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a Globally remote role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The role entails&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaping the roadmap for your product at global sprints every six months&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Working towards mastery of key programming languages and Linux system knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engaging with users and the open source community through code reviews and issue trackers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responding to customer issues as a priority, develop an understanding of enterprise requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing skills and awareness of security in software design and implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal responsibility and accountability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thoughtfulness, self-awareness and the ability to reflect and develop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel internationally twice a year for company events up to two weeks long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nice-to-have skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upstream open source contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packaging and Linux distribution contributions - Debian, Fedora, Arch, Nix or another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leadership and organization skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation and writing skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business and commercial interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits which reflect our values and ideals.

                &lt;p&gt;This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology on autonomous devices across all seniority levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world&#39;s most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while classic, ‘deb’ based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These roles include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu Core and snapd software development&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silicon software and optimisation engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware-centric Linux QA Engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware Certification Engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robotics engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industrial IoT software engineers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We&#39;re looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What your day will look like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with the latest Linux kernel and open source technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliver Ubuntu for the latest IoT and server-class hardware platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate and maintain device-oriented software stacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write high-quality, well-designed software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate proactively with other globally distributed teams&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display technical leadership internally and within our external communities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help our customers ship their apps and SDKs on Ubuntu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build device OS images with Ubuntu Core, Desktop and Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimise the Ubuntu kernel and libraries for silicon-specific capabilities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debug issues and produce high-quality code to fix them&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to technical documentation to make it the best of its kind&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss ideas and collaborate on finding good solutions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate as technical lead on complex customer engagements involving complete system architectures from cloud to edge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work usually from home, with global travel 2 to 4 weeks for company events&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This is a general track for security-focused engineering in every team at Canonical, across all levels of seniority. Apply here if you are already an exceptional security-focused software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most product engineering teams at Canonical include one or two spaces for dedicated security-oriented software engineers. Their role is to challenge the entire team to think more deeply about security. They contribute to the product as engineers too, but their primary focus is to improve security through state of the art practices - from table-top threat model exercises to architecture reviews, from extended security testing with fuzzers and static analysis tools to external security analyst liaison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also build a number of products that are entirely motivated by security technology and requirements, such as our AppArmor kernel investments and our hardening, compliance and certification toolkits for Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the publisher of Ubuntu we also handle long-term security response and hardening for the entire operating system and open source universe. Working with tens of thousands of upstreams means that we need to be fluent in every major programming language, and design, build and adopt sophisticated tools that enable us to work at scale and speed with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These roles encompass all aspects of product security, including feature development, vulnerability response, proactive security and open source community participation. All security roles interact closely with many of the other Canonical engineering and development teams, Canonical customers and our partners across the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location: We have open roles for security specialist software engineers in every timezone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you&#39;ll do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security roles might tackle any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define, implement and document new security features&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead security-oriented thinking in a product engineering team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze, fix, and test vulnerabilities in Canonical and open source Software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to Ubuntu and upstream projects to benefit the community&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audit and analyze source code for vulnerabilities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate new tools in our security infrastructure, pipelines and processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieve and retain various security certifications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend and enhance Linux cryptographic components - specifically with modules such as OpenSSL/Libgcrypt - with the features and functionality required for country-specific compliance such as FIPS and CC certification&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with external partners to develop CIS benchmarks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and develop hardening automation for Ubuntu&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor the security industry for new developments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, test and maintain new software capabilities&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide guidance and support to other engineering teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A thorough understanding of the common categories of security vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern engineering techniques to find and fix them&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with open source development tools and methodologies&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skill in one or more of C, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby or PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience as a security champion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience driving security within a wider SDLC process&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

Our engineering directors set the pace and the direction to help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though this is a senior management position, managing managers, we expect Engineering Directors to be outstanding developers with the confidence to lead by example across the full range of activities in their teams. You need to understand what great code looks like in the language and genre of your product - whether that is a web service, or a system daemon, or a desktop application, or a distributed system. You’ll need to know how to drive testing and benchmarking to improve the clarity in your teams around quality and performance. You’ll also need to be confident to set and defend high expectations of work ethic, consistency, focus and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hiring Software Engineering Managers to lead technical teams in the various aspects of the delivery and ongoing support and maintenance of all Linux kernels provided by the Ubuntu Linux distribution.&amp;nbsp; As the Linux kernel itself is now quite broad, so are the technical domains and challenges involved, ranging from integrating support for bleeding-edge hardware into the latest Ubuntu kernels, to expanding the range of execution environments available to Ubuntu, to the complexities inherent in applying the latest fixes and updates to all of the &amp;gt;100 Ubuntu Linux kernels under active support during our Stable Release Update cycles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role would suit either an experienced manager of high performing software development teams, or a very proficient technical lead who is excited to take on a management responsibility. You will need to be passionate about Linux and aspire to be an integral part in its distribution to millions of users worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Engineering Manager at Canonical, your primary responsibility is to your team: helping them grow as engineers, do important and satisfying work, and have a great time while doing it. Technical leadership experience and a background in software engineering are necessary prerequisites for this role. You will be expected to lead, challenge, and develop strong engineers, positively influence the culture, facilitate technical delivery, and work with your team on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Working from home, worldwide.&amp;nbsp; We have kernel teams and openings in every time zone and with the notable exception of Taipei, Taiwan, have no offices and therefore no pressure to work from an office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role entails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leading a distributed team of software engineers in your geographic region in distinct aspects of delivery of all Linux kernels for the Ubuntu Linux distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking ownership of particular aspects of Ubuntu Linux which can include but not be limited to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with silicon or cloud partners to implement Linux kernels optimised for their execution environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring Ubuntu Linux is able to run on a wide range of diverse hardware platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition and execution of the stringent quality control standards expected by the Ubuntu user community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitigation of the latest security threats and exploits to the Linux kernel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong process automation as it pertains to the build, test, and delivery of the Linux kernel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engagement with other teams at Canonical, the open source community and commercial partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significant programming experience in C, with Python, Golang, or other like languages is also highly regarded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substantial experience with operating system kernel internals and concepts, Linux would be highly regarded but not essential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience managing or leading a team of software engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to coordinate between multiple distinct teams of differing technical focus to achieve common goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with version control practices, ideally with git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior experience developing with software packaging formats, with direct Ubuntu/Debian/Snap experience being highly regarded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to travel internationally twice a year for company events up to two weeks long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice-to-have skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience with kernel patching and debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong grasp of device drivers, BSP’s, and other low level system engineering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid background in driving CI/CD and process automation initiatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior public involvement with an open source project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits which reflect our values and ideals.

&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You’ll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help us shape the future of open source IT, devops, and IS, from bare metal to containers. Our goal is to revolutionise open source application and infrastructure operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to transform the world of software operations by enabling true model-driven operations via next-generation infrastructure-as-code. This will allow companies to run very efficient bare-metal operations for high-performance computing, private cloud, data lakes, AI/ML, and analytics. We need to invent some new technology, and we need to build some new products; we are therefore looking for someone who can lead and inspire a regional software engineering team to fulfill this initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Solutions Engineering team works in close collaboration with our managed infrastructure operations team, which runs many private OpenStack clouds and Kubernetes clusters for customers around the world. This enables us to improve our infra-as-code products based on our own real experience, mirroring that of our users and customers. We work in Python, creating open source automation capabilities that simplify operations for anybody, anywhere, who is building on Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the team&#39;s work involves pure Python software development focused on enabling true DevOps workflows. We strive for high quality in both design, documentation, tests, and performance as we enhance operations code packages and Ubuntu itself in order to ensure our platform is the easiest, most robust, and best performing for driving your infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for software engineers who want to work in a global team, have a passion for distributed systems and cloud computing, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work on turning radical new ideas in the fraud detection space into reality. Our products are developer-focused and our clients range from solo developers to publicly traded companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;We are a globally dispersed, 100% remote company&lt;/strong&gt; with a strong open-source focus. Our flagship open-source project is &lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--focus-visible&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;FingerprintJS&lt;/a&gt; (20K stars on GitHub).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a &lt;strong&gt;Senior Software Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; (Golang) to focus on building a global scale device intelligence network that helps our customers make fraud prevention decisions quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role will be working closely with stakeholders on an alpha product and adapting to changing requirements, delivering quick results for a faster time-to-market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;What we’re looking for:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5+ years of Golang experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive experience using large-scale databases like ClickHouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with data transformation tools like dbt and the ability to analyze high volumes of data in a DWH system to answer key questions/solve customer problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with AWS container technologies like ECS/Fargate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience in API architecture and implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience designing and maintaining scalable public APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to thrive in ambiguous environments where you get to work directly with stakeholders with minimal guidance and direction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong communication skills (English) and collaboration skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This role includes participation in a shared on-call rotation. The schedule will be communicated in advance, and we strive to balance coverage equitably while minimizing off-hours disruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ideally, we would love to have someone who also has:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous Experience with queueing and streaming systems (SQS, Kafka)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concurrent programming experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation Range&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;$152-220k For cash compensation, we set standard ranges for all &lt;strong&gt;US based roles based&lt;/strong&gt; on function, level and geographic location, benchmarked against similar stage growth companies. In order to be compliant with local legislation, as well as to provide greater transparency to candidates, we share salary ranges on all job postings regardless of desired hiring location. &lt;strong&gt;Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including geographic location as well as candidate experience and expertise, and may vary from the amounts listed above.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
