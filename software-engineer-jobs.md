<div>We are a remote startup (headquartered in Canada) building a smart, curious, and driven team that’s making software to help sales reps sell better.</div><div>
<br>Prospect is a lead generation app that helps you find contact data right inside your browser in real-time. The best sales teams from the top tech companies in the world use Prospect to crush their sales targets.</div><div><strong><br>MORE ABOUT US</strong></div><div>
<br>We are currently a team of 15 people -- you will be #16 🙂</div><div>
<br>We are self-funded and profitable (no VCs or investors). We did this because we want to do what’s best for our team and customers.</div><div>
<br>Authoritative leadership style is practiced here, where the overall goal is given and you have the freedom to choose your own way of achieving it.</div><div>

<br>You like shipping things. You realize that building excellent products is a marathon, not a sprint, and regularly make improvements in iterations.</div><div>
<br>You are an excellent communicator. You realize that working remotely requires thoughtful communication and you do so through great written communication.</div><div>
