&lt;p&gt;Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under their own brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn, create a meaningful impact in their own lives.

&lt;p&gt;Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey, Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still more to come!&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world&#39;s leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are hiring a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Software Engineer for Distributed Systems Testing&lt;/strong&gt; with a passion for building and validating resilient distributed systems. You drive the success of those leveraging Canonical’s Ubuntu and Juju to build multi-cloud deployable applications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We see quality engineering as a first class engineering practice and are looking for people who can bring deep engineering insights and a data driven approach to testing, test automation, reporting and data analytics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Distributed Systems testing team at Canonical is responsible for the high quality of Canonical’s Cloud solutions based on for example Juju, Terraform, OpenStack, or Kubernetes. Systems are tested and deployed under highly diverse conditions, from bare metal in customer data centers to public clouds such as AWS, GCE, Azure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As a software engineer you will have the opportunity to develop CI pipelines which power Canonical’s cloud integration testing and reporting. You will help test our products on new clouds and advance our AI/ML pipelines for automatic analysis of test results. A successful candidate is interested in tackling these problems, as well as imagining and leading new initiatives within the team and across Canonical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role entails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Creating automated testing approaches and infrastructure for validating reliability, performance, and resilience of cloud orchestration tools and applications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Enabling engineering teams across Canonical to develop software with confidence by making distributed system testing tooling available across the company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Enhancing continuous integration pipelines for deploying and testing Canonical’s cloud native products such as Kubeflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Deploying, managing, and debugging highly distributed systems on clouds and bare metal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Monitoring and reporting on automated testing efforts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Collaborating daily with a globally distributed team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we are looking for in you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Solid background in modern test processes and strategies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Experience with Python or Go development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Strong object oriented development skills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Working knowledge of continuous integration tools such as Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Knowledge of networking technologies and fundamentals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Solid understanding of the Linux system architecture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Data collection and analytics skills for large multidimensional datasets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we offer colleagues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual compensation review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognition rewards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual holiday leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maternity and paternity leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team Member Assistance Program &amp;amp; Wellness Platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity to travel to new locations to meet colleagues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priority Pass and travel upgrades for long-haul company events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Collaborate with Speechify’s Product Teams to scope projects, find ways to reduce scope to get faster feedback from customers, navigate the integration/UX tradeoffs relevant to different product teams, and deliver solutions via our cross-platform SDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Optimize existing functionality to ship things like faster loading and more intelligent parsing by designing more efficient abstractions and improving our algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Ship cloud functions, lightweight backend services, and jobs using Kotlin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Ideal Candidate Should Have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systems thinking. You know that optimizing a system requires end-to-end design, and you believe simplicity is valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Speed. You work quickly to generate ideas and options and know how to decide which things can ship now and what things need time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Focus. We’re a high-growth startup with a busy, remote team. You know how and when to engage or be heads down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Collaboration. You know how to inspire, play, and negotiate with opinionated designers, marketers, and PMs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Preferred Tech Stack:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;1&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Kotlin Multiplatform (Java experience is OK but role is Kotlin Multiplatform)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;1&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Prior experience with GCP is a plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-speechify-sentence=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Offer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fast-growing environment where you can help shape the company and product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An entrepreneurial-minded team that supports risk, intuition, and hustle.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Competitive salaries, a friendly and laid-back atmosphere, and a commitment to building a great asynchronous culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity to work on a life-changing product that millions of people use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build products that directly impact and support people with learning differences like dyslexia, ADD, low vision, concussions, autism, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
