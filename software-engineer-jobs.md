&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4&quot;&gt;everyone can code&lt;/a&gt;, not just ~0.1% of the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating developers &lt;/strong&gt;with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating repetitive tasks,&lt;/strong&gt; from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/&quot;&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/&quot;&gt;Redpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🌎 While we hire &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcegraph.notion.site/How-we-engage-talent-outside-of-the-US-218f7193695a46cbb1ef39ef9c1f72d4&quot;&gt;almost anywhere&lt;/a&gt; in the world, we have a preference for someone to reside in the following locations for this role. However, if you feel qualified, we welcome you to apply regardless of location. No matter what, working hours must overlap with the PST timezone for at least 20 hours/week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preferred location:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote - USA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this job is exciting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source code is at the heart of Sourcegraph. We support multiple code hosts and retrieve, store, index, and serve source code - to end users, admins, and other internal services. Our latest addition to our product catalog, Cody, reimagines how code is written and supercharges our developer customers. Sourcegraph hosts the infrastructure for our customers to manage their source code (search, insights, own, etc.) and our brand new AI Code Assistant (Cody).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cody Prime team is responsible for the Enterprise service layer for Cody, providing services &amp;amp; tools to help Cody succeed in secure enterprise environments, and making it easier for Cody Core team to build enterprise-friendly features. This is a new and unmapped space, building an AI product that meets high regulatory and compliance standards. As an engineer on the Cody Prime team, you will work closely with engineers on the Cody Core and Core Services teams. You will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and operate resilient and secure services providing authorization and authentication for Cody&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a roadmap and tooling for abuse detection and mitigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend and operate analytics services collecting data around usage metering, license management, billing, and rate limiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within one month, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard onto the Sourcegraph architecture, tooling, and development workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a solid understanding of the team’s areas of ownership, technical challenges, and problems the team solves for our customers, and know how all of these align with the top-level company goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively participate in team meetings, sharing ideas and insights to contribute to the overall team goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start contributing to the team goals and deliverables by shipping new features, debugging issues, and fixing bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within three months, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate an understanding of the Cody Prime service stack, its underlying technologies, and its integration within the Sourcegraph ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the implementation of new features or improvements in Go, with occasional opportunities to work on front-end features using JavaScript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in initiatives contributing to team goals on the roadmap by going through the entire product development lifecycle discovery, design, implementation, and delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in support of our production services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 Within six months, you will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate a deep understanding of the Cody Gateway and Cody Analytics products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute new features to both services with assistance from senior engineers on the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with teams across the company on projects that benefit from cross-team expertise, particularly those involving monetization or analytics of the Cody product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bring a product mindset in balancing design philosophy with meeting customer demand, balancing the requirements of enterprise-grade production services with the rapid iteration requirements of the AI space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think in terms of building self-service platforms and APIs, which reduce manual operations and enable other developers. You balance maintaining and designing high-impact systems with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g., cut scope, low-tech vs. custom complex solutions) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary. You’re excited to work in a new space, bringing enterprise-grade security to an AI chat product. You are strongly aligned with &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcegraph.notion.site/Mission-values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d&quot;&gt;our values&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by our mission to make it so that everyone can code, and motivated to do your best work at Sourcegraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear and empathetic communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in Go (or other strongly typed languages with a desire, willingness, and ability to quickly ramp up on effective Go.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General knowledge about deploying/managing/utilizing services in Cloud environments (GCP, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD, etc. or similar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skilled at architecting, debugging, building, testing, and reasoning about moderately complex distributed systems which intersect APIs and Services provided by other teams &amp;amp; companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable reasoning about API performance, service monitoring, metrics, alerting, etc. in moderately complex distributed systems (writing such code, and general intuition skills around OS primitives like network/CPU/memory, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eagerness to help and assist other internal (and occasionally external) engineers with the institutional knowledge you will help build on the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on small high-performing teams, preferably tech startups, or a strong desire to join a fast-paced async team environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your working hours overlap with 9am-5pm &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.is/PT&quot;&gt;PT&lt;/a&gt; for at least 15 hours per week so we have time to collaborate synchronously when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with monitoring/alerting technologies such as: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, OpsGenie, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with API technologies such as: HTTP text streams, WebSockets, REST, gRPC, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable developing services that fit broader organizational preferences (neither micro-services nor monoliths, balancing and reasoning about such tradeoffs.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General familiarity with payment processing, authentication, etc. technologies or a desire to learn their usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with, or an eagerness to learn about, interacting with most AI/LLM APIs in the world, their nuances and intricacies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(243, 78, 63);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      <p>This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels.</p>
<p>We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.</p>
<p>Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.</p>
<p>These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.</p>
<p>But while classic, ‘deb’ based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.</p>
<p>We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general.

      <p>This is a general track for security-focused engineering in every team at Canonical, across all levels of seniority. Apply here if you are already an exceptional security-focused software engineer.</p>
<p>Most product engineering teams at Canonical include one or two spaces for dedicated security-oriented software engineers. Their role is to challenge the entire team to think more deeply about security. They contribute to the product as engineers too, but their primary focus is to improve security through state of the art practices - from table-top threat model exercises to architecture reviews, from extended security testing with fuzzers and static analysis tools to external security analyst liaison.</p>
<p>We also build a number of products that are entirely motivated by security technology and requirements, such as our AppArmor kernel investments and our hardening, compliance and certification toolkits for Ubuntu.</p>
<p>As the publisher of Ubuntu we also handle long-term security response and hardening for the entire operating system and open source universe. Working with tens of thousands of upstreams means that we need to be fluent in every major programming language, and design, build and adopt sophisticated tools that enable us to work at scale and speed with confidence.</p>
<p>These roles encompass all aspects of product security, including feature development, vulnerability response, proactive security and open source community participation. All security roles interact closely with many of the other Canonical engineering and development teams, Canonical customers and our partners across the open source community.</p>
<p>Location: We have open roles for security specialist software engineers in every timezone.</p>

<li>Contribute to Ubuntu and upstream projects to benefit the community&nbsp;</li>
<li>Audit and analyze source code for vulnerabilities&nbsp;</li>
<li>Integrate new tools in our security infrastructure, pipelines and processes</li>
<li>Achieve and retain various security certifications&nbsp;</li>
<li>Extend and enhance Linux cryptographic components - specifically with modules such as OpenSSL/Libgcrypt - with the features and functionality required for country-specific compliance such as FIPS and CC certification&nbsp;</li>
<li>Work with external partners to develop CIS benchmarks</li>
<li>Design and develop hardening automation for Ubuntu&nbsp;</li>
<li>Monitor the security industry for new developments&nbsp;</li>
<li>Develop, test and maintain new software capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

                <h3><strong>About Atticus</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">At any given time, 16 million Americans are experiencing a crisis that requires urgent help from our legal system or government. The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">We've helped more than 20,000 people in need (see our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atticus.com">6,000+ five-star reviews</a>) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We just closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 52 to 91 last year and we expect to grow again in 2024.</p><h3><strong>The Job</strong></h3><p style="min-height:1.5em">To provide a great experience for a client, we have to do a lot quickly: Understand their situation, identify their needs, give advice, match them with the right lawyer, connect them to that lawyer, convince both parties to work together, and formalize the arrangement — all while doing our best to make a complex and scary system feel simple, accessible, and human. We’ve managed to do all of this in a way that users love, but we’ve done it by leaving some parts of the process quite manual... which means we can only scale so far.</p><p style="min-height:1.5em">Your job is to change that: to lead the effort to transform our product into a platform that can serve millions of people. You'll craft a strategic plan and roadmap that will enable our tech stack to scale 10x in volume we currently support and plant the seeds for 20x. The role mixes engineering strategy, architectural decisions, and people management.

We do not require a long, professional experience with it; but you'll need to master key principles and be able to write some code during the tech interview (you can use LLMs but we'll check that you understand what you accept).</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">T-shaped profile: you have a full-stack mindset (eager to dig into the back-end, front-end or infrastructure aspects of a problem) with a spike in one area in particular where you excel.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Sense of ownership: you have a holistic approach to problem solving, you are able to make decisions after collecting data and input from relevant stakeholders, even if there's no clear consensus, and you are accountable for them.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Team spirit: you do your best to align yourself and the people around you with the company's mission, strategy and culture. You are operationally flexible, and able to adapt to an evolving environment.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are excited to work in a written-first and async-first environment (though we still have many occasions to speak face-to-face!), where radical transparency is a core value.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You have a stellar communication, especially in written form. You welcome feedback and challenges; you can express your point of view clearly and without compromission, but also without antagonizing others, in a way that moves conversations towards a conclusion.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">People love working with you: you have a positive energy, you like to help others even when it's not your responsibility, and you place a high premium on maintaining good relationships with the team.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">You are passionate about technology and how to use it to solve real-life problems, in particular in the field of education and training. You are aware of the GenAI field, and you know how to leverage it, including in your job as an engineer.</p></li></ul><h1>Interview process</h1><ul style="min-height:1.5em"><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Apply to this position by answering a few written questions. Though we love LLMs, please use your own words 🙏 We don't expect more than a paragraph per question.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">If your profile catches our attention, we'll invite you for a screening interview. We'll ask you a few questions and you'll have time to ask us questions too.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">If we're both willing to move forward, we'll send a take-home exercise and we'll schedule a technical interview with our engineers.</p></li><li><p style="min-height:1.5em">Finally, you'll have a chat about product engineering and our company culture with our CTO and/or a Product Manager.</p></li></ul><p style="min-height:1.5em"><em>🇫🇷 Sauf mention contraire, toutes nos offres sont accessibles en télétravail complet à condition de travailler dans un fuseau horaire proche de celui de Paris et de disposer des bonnes conditions de travail (notamment connexion Internet).

&lt;p&gt;We are Orderly, the ultimate destination for decentralized trading platforms. We are not satisfied with the limitations of centralized exchanges or the complexities of building decentralized order books. We aim to make trading easy, fast, and secure for everyone. How? By fusing the simplicity of CeFi with the power of DeFi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of the issue lies “liquidity”. Builders often grapple with a paradox; traders need liquidity, but liquidity demands traders. Our solution is simple as is bold –&lt;span class=&quot;text-primary-100 font-semibold&quot;&gt;concentrate all liquidity into one order book. One order book that connects all the liquidity in the crypto space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our ambition doesn&#39;t stop there. We&#39;re omnichain, championing chain abstraction. We envision seamless transactions, where the underlying blockchain is merely a detail. By concentrating liquidity, we aim to redefine the crypto landscape, making bridging and wrapped assets a thing of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are Orderly, and we are here to revolutionize DeFi, democratizing access to financial opportunities and fostering a fair, equitable paradigm for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Glimpse into Your Future at Orderly Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with the best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are Orderly, the ultimate destination for decentralized trading platforms. We are not satisfied with the limitations of centralized exchanges or the complexities of building decentralized order books. We aim to make trading easy, fast, and secure for everyone. How? By fusing the simplicity of CeFi with the power of DeFi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of the issue lies “liquidity”. Builders often grapple with a paradox; traders need liquidity, but liquidity demands traders. Our solution is simple as is bold –&lt;span class=&quot;text-primary-100 font-semibold&quot;&gt;concentrate all liquidity into one order book. One order book that connects all the liquidity in the crypto space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our ambition doesn&#39;t stop there. We&#39;re omnichain, championing chain abstraction. We envision seamless transactions, where the underlying blockchain is merely a detail. By concentrating liquidity, we aim to redefine the crypto landscape, making bridging and wrapped assets a thing of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are Orderly, and we are here to revolutionize DeFi, democratizing access to financial opportunities and fostering a fair, equitable paradigm for all.&lt;/p&gt;
