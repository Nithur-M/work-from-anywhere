Appreciate the challenge of creating safe ways of executing untrusted third-party code? Want to spend every day discussing chewy problems with great people?

Youâve come to the right place.Â <strong></strong></p><p dir="ltr">Weâre building the worldâs first purpose-built engine for decentralized finance. Delivering safe, approachable, parallelizable programming suitable for global finance on an open distributed ledger. The big pieces of the design are done, the market test data is in, our community is building like crazy on our pre-alpha, and we know we have a hit on our hands.Â  Now we need to get the next big release across the line and then turn our sights to designing v-next-next.<strong></strong></p><p dir="ltr">We are seeking an Engineer with a hefty background in some mix of compilers, virtual machines, and systems design to help implement the execution layer backing our unique asset-oriented programming model.</p><p dir="ltr">Youâll start with a period of intense research while you come up the curve on the design and function of the Radix Engine.

This revolution is being fuelled by decentralized finance (or DeFi for short), which is enabling an assortment of pioneering developers and entrepreneurs to re-invent almost every financial product that is currently traded and invested in traditional markets, without requiring central authorities or siloed infrastructure. DeFi has captured a great deal of attention and investment in the crypto-aware niche, growing assets under management from $1 billion to over $200 billion in a few years. Impressive as its growth has been, its current market size isn't even a rounding error on the over $400 trillion held in traditional finance. We're focused on what it will take to go from billions to trillions.</p><p dir="ltr">RDX went back to first principles to come up with the right technical solutionâthe first layer-one protocol built specifically for mainstream DeFiâand we have already tested out at over 1 million transactions per second. We're keenly aware that the need for an infinitely scalable platform is only one prerequisite among many for mass adoption, and we're also blazing new ground in the areas of purpose-built developer tools, user experiences, and regulatory integration.</p><p dir="ltr">We have forged a path deep into the future of what distributed ledger technology is going to look like and we need you to come and be part of the team that is making that happen right now.</p><p dir="ltr">If this job sounds like it was made for you, then please apply directly via the link or if you donât have an up-to-date CV to apply with, please contact careers@rdx.works for more information.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out our company benefits here - <a href="https://www.rdx.works/careers">RDX Works Benefits</a></p><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, if you feel like you donât match all of the requirements, we would love you to still apply anyway. We understand that confidence gaps and imposter syndrome can get in the way of meeting incredible candidates and we wouldnât want this to prevent us from meeting you; especially as we are big advocates of helping people learn &amp; grow. This is also another reason we do not advertise salaries, we want to keep it as even a playing field as possible!Â </p>
