                &lt;p&gt;The mission of Speechify is to make sure that reading is never a barrier to learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 50 million people use Speechify’s text-to-speech products to turn whatever they’re reading – PDFs, books, Google Docs, news articles, websites – into audio, so they can read faster, read more, and remember more. Speechify’s text-to-speech reading products include its iOS app, Android App, Mac App, Chrome Extension, and Web App. Google recently named Speechify the Chrome Extension of the Year and Apple named Speechify its App of the Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, nearly 200 people around the globe work on Speechify in a 100% distributed setting – Speechify has no office. These include frontend and backend engineers, AI research scientists, and others from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, leading PhD programs like Stanford, high growth startups like Stripe, Vercel, Bolt, and many founders of their own companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a key role and ideal for someone who thinks strategically, enjoys fast-paced environments, passionate about making product decisions, and has experience building great user experiences that delight users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a flat organization that allows anyone to become a leader by showing excellent technical skills and delivering results consistently and fast. Work ethic, solid communication skills, and obsession with winning are paramount.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our interview process involves several technical interviews and we aim to complete them within 1 week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The mission of Speechify is to make sure that reading is never a barrier to learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 50 million people use Speechify’s text-to-speech products to turn whatever they’re reading – PDFs, books, Google Docs, news articles, websites – into audio, so they can read faster, read more, and remember more. Speechify’s text-to-speech reading products include its iOS app, Android App, Mac App, Chrome Extension, and Web App. Google recently named Speechify the Chrome Extension of the Year and Apple named Speechify its App of the Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, nearly 200 people around the globe work on Speechify in a 100% distributed setting – Speechify has no office. These include frontend and backend engineers, AI research scientists, and others from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, leading PhD programs like Stanford, high growth startups like Stripe, Vercel, Bolt, and many founders of their own companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a key role and ideal for someone who thinks strategically, enjoys fast-paced environments, passionate about making product decisions, and has experience building great user experiences that delight users.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The mission of Speechify is to make sure that reading is never a barrier to learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 50 million people use Speechify’s text-to-speech products to turn whatever they’re reading – PDFs, books, Google Docs, news articles, websites – into audio, so they can read faster, read more, and remember more. Speechify’s text-to-speech reading products include its iOS app, Android App, Mac App, Chrome Extension, and Web App. Google recently named Speechify the Chrome Extension of the Year and Apple named Speechify its App of the Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, nearly 200 people around the globe work on Speechify in a 100% distributed setting – Speechify has no office. These include frontend and backend engineers, AI research scientists, and others from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, leading PhD programs like Stanford, high growth startups like Stripe, Vercel, Bolt, and many founders of their own companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a key role and ideal for someone who thinks strategically, enjoys fast-paced environments, passionate about making product decisions, and has experience building great user experiences that delight users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a flat organization that allows anyone to become a leader by showing excellent technical skills and delivering results consistently and fast. Work ethic, solid communication skills, and obsession with winning are paramount.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our interview process involves several technical interviews and we aim to complete them within 1 week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
