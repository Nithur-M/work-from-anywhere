<p>Our app is now downloaded more than 75M times a year, and our private search engine packaged with it has become the #2 search engine on mobile in over 21 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands. Oh, and we've been profitable since 2014 with revenue currently exceeding $100 million a year! Now, we’re rolling out a suite of new privacy solutions, including <u><a href="https://www.spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/" rel="noopener">Email Protection</a></u>,  <u><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-app-tracking-protection/" rel="noopener">App Tracking Protection</a></u><a rel="noopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>and our first-ever Desktop Apps for <u><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-duckduckgo-for-mac/" rel="noopener">Mac</a></u><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-duckduckgo-for-mac/" rel="noopener"> </a>and Windows.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We’re looking for a <strong><strong>Senior Software Engineer, Windows Desktop App</strong></strong> to help shape our all-in-one privacy solution and join our mission to show the world that protecting your privacy online can be simple.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong> </p>
<p>In this role, you will work on the team responsible for launching our first ever DuckDuckGo Privacy App for Windows.

<p><br></p>
<p>You will be critical to the successful launch of this product and responsible for taking pieces of the puzzle and autonomously building solutions to get us closer to our first release. You will help define the roadmap, take ownership of significant application features and experiment with ways to improve them. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You will lay the foundations of what will become one of DuckDuckGo's flagship products and critical levers for growing privacy online. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>What You Will Bring to DuckDuckGo</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Experience implementing ideas from scratch, owning major application features, and taking responsibility for their maintenance and improvement over time.</li>

We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.</p>
<p>We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.</p>
<p>This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers.

<h3>What you’ll do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code</li>
<li>Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications</li>
<li>Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability</li>
<li>Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure</li>
<li>Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community</li>
<li>Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code</li>
<li>Follow agile software development practices</li>
<li>Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights</li>
<li>Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values</li>
<li>Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who you are</h3>
<ul>
<li>You love technology and working with brilliant people</li>
<li>You have a Bachelor’s or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree</li>
<li>You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations</li>
<li>You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud</li>
<li>You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes</li>
<li>You are an experienced Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects</li>
<li>You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation</li>
<li>You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software</li>
