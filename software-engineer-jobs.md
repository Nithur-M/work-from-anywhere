&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re seeking a &lt;strong&gt;Typescript Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; to help lead the development of our browser-based technologies—including our JavaScript agent, Pro CDN, and other performance-critical components. In this role, you’ll build high-integrity, privacy-aware, and tamper-resistant code that runs across diverse browser environments and powers advanced device intelligence and security solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This position is ideal for engineers who thrive in deeply technical environments and enjoy working close to the metal in the browser runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and maintain our browser-side TypeScript/JavaScript agent used for device identification, bot detection, and risk assessment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to a widely-used open-source project with 24K+ GitHub stars and 25B+ monthly usages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineer for stealth, resilience, and performance—minimizing footprint, resisting detection, and maintaining compatibility across browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize for both code size and execution speed in complex, adversarial environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay ahead of browser changes, plugin behaviors, and fingerprinting techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with backend, security, and data science teams to align signal capture with detection logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write comprehensive tests and contribute to CI pipelines that ensure functionality across a wide range of platforms and devices&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expert-level JavaScript and TypeScript experience, especially in browser environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep understanding of browser APIs, DOM behavior, timing attacks, and anti-debugging techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency with build tools like Webpack, and (or) Rollup, Esbuild, including code obfuscation and minification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with modern testing frameworks such as Jasmine, Jest, or similar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong sense of ownership and autonomy—comfortable working in fast-paced environments without rigid specifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear written and verbal communication skills in English&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with security principles, privacy best practices, and adversarial engineering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High level of personal ownership and autonomy, which requires experience working without clearly defined requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to Have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributions to open-source projects, especially in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with WebAssembly, browser extensions, or remote debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with AWS services such as Lambda, CloudFront, and DynamoDB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser automation experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates&#39; personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from underrepresented groups in tech to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
