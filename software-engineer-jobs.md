<h3><strong>Who we are</strong></h3>
<p>The Compensation Product Platform team (CPP) is working alongside the other Comp teams to get Lattice‚Äôs compensation product through the exciting time of our initial release, and working with Product to explore this new space with a lot of greenfield work! As a platform team CPP is specifically focussing on much of the core back end functionality such as data ingestion &amp; modeling, designing APIs, building out the new Hoodwink service, breaking stuff out of the Weaver monolith, performance and reliability tuning, and building out functionality for both internal and external users as we‚Äôre actively figuring out where to steer the product. This is a great opportunity for someone who gets dopamine hits from solving some of the meatier, back end platform type problems, and enjoys being an active part of the conversation around how we‚Äôre building out a brand new product.</p>
